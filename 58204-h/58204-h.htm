</div>
<p class='c006'>The need of a reinterpretation of Greek economic theory in the
light of our modern humanitarian economy is presented in the
introduction to this work. If this volume may, in some degree,
meet such a need, by awakening the classicist to the existence of
important phases of Greek thought with which he is too unfamiliar,
and by reminding the economist of the many vital points of contact
between Greek and modern economy, our labor will have been
amply repaid. There are doubtless errors both in citations and
in judgment which will not escape the critic’s eye. We trust,
however, that the work is, on the whole, a fair representation of
the thought of the Greeks in this important field. In the course
of our study, we have naturally been obliged to make constant
reference to the actual economic environment of the Greeks, as
a proper background for their theories. It is therefore our purpose
to publish, at some future date, a general history of economic
conditions in Greece, which may serve as a companion to this
volume.</p>

<p class='c002'>We gladly take this opportunity to express our gratitude to
Professor Paul Shorey, of the University of Chicago, for his suggestion
of the subject of this work, as also for his many helpful
criticisms and suggestions during the course of its preparation.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>For a complete list of scholars who have devoted more or less
attention to the economic ideas of Greek thinkers, the reader is
referred to the bibliography at the conclusion of this work. On
the surface, the list appears to be reasonably extensive. It will be
observed, however, that the majority of the works are not of recent
date; that many of them deal largely with the practical phase of
economics; that most of the larger works on economic history treat
Greek economic and social theory in a merely incidental manner,
and that nearly all are written from the general standpoint of the
economist rather than with the more detailed analysis of the classicist.
The work of Souchon, the most extensive, careful, and satisfactory
discussion of the subject, is no exception to this latter rule,
and since his standpoint is too exclusively that of the older English
economists, his criticism of the Greek theories is not always sufficiently
sympathetic. The monumental volumes of Poehlmann
have treated Greek social theories thoroughly, but the chief interest
of the author is rather in the actual social conditions, and his
work is marred by a constant overemphasis of the analogy between
ancient and modern capitalism and socialistic agitation. Moreover,
there is no book in the English language, on Greek economic
thought, that treats the subject in anything more than the cursory
manner of Haney and Ingram.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> There is, thus, still a place for
a work of this type in the English language, written from the
standpoint of the classicist, but with a view also to the needs of
twentieth-century students of economics.</p>

<p class='c002'>The present work aims to fulfil such a need. Its scope differs
quite essentially from all other accounts of Greek theory previously
published, in that our purpose is not merely to consider
the extent to which the Greek thinkers grasped the principles of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the orthodox economy of Ricardo and Mill. We shall also endeavor
to ascertain how far they, by the humanitarian and ethical tone
of their thinking, anticipated the modern, post-Ruskin economy,
which makes man, not property, the supreme goal, and recognizes
the multiplicity of human interests and strivings that belie the
old theory of the “economic man.” Our verdict as to the importance
of the Greek contribution to economic thought is thus likely
to be somewhat more favorable than that which is usually rendered.</p>

<p class='c002'>We purpose also to emphasize more than is often done the
important fact that Greek theory is essentially a reflection of
Greek economic conditions, and that a true interpretation of the
thought depends upon a clear understanding of the economic history
of Greece. However, as we shall see, this by no means implies
that the anti-capitalistic theories of the Socratics are evidence of
an undeveloped state of commerce and industry in fifth- and
fourth-century Athens.</p>

<p class='c002'>The method of presentation is primarily chronological. Thus
the ideas of each thinker can be discussed in a more thorough and
unitary manner, and more in relation to the contemporary economic
conditions that gave rise to them. Moreover, despite some
practical advantages of the topical method, it savors too much of
an artificial attempt to force the Greek thinkers on the procrustean
rack of the concepts of modern economy.</p>

<p class='c002'>The general characteristics of Greek economic thought have
often been enumerated. They may be restated with advantage,
at this point, together with some additions and needed criticisms.</p>

<p class='c002'>1. <i>Simplicity.</i>—The theory of economics as a separate science
never developed in Greece. The consideration of economic problems
was incidental to the pursuit of politics and ethics. In so far
as Greek thinkers treated such subjects, their theories reflect the
comparative simplicity of their economic environment. Without
prejudging the issue as to the actual extent of capitalism in ancient
Athens, we need only to think away the vast international scope
of our modern commercial problems, our giant manufacturing
plants with their steam and electric power, our enormous wealth
and its extreme concentration, the untold complexity of modern
business and finance, the vast territorial expanse of modern nations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>almost all our luxuries and commonplace comforts, to begin to
appreciate something of this ancient simplicity.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> However, as
a direct result of this limitation, the Greeks were led to deal with
their problems more in terms of men than in terms of things, and
thus their economic vision was sometimes clearer and truer than
our own. Aristotle struck the keynote in Greek economic thought
in stating that the primary interest of economy is human beings
rather than inanimate property.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>2. <i>Confusion of private and public economy.</i>—As a result of this
simplicity, the terms οἰκονομία and οἰκονομική were, both in derivation
and largely in usage, referred to household management
rather than to public economy.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Domestic and public economy
were regularly defined as differing merely in extent.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Aristotle,
however, distinctly criticizes the confusion of the two.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Moreover,
there is no warrant for the frequent assertion that Greek
thinkers never rose above the conception of domestic economy.
Xenophon’s treatise on the <i>Revenues of Athens</i>, and Aristotle’s
entire philosophy of the state are a sufficient answer to such generalizations.
The statement of Professor Barker that “political
economy,” to Aristotle, would be a “contradiction in terms,” is
extreme.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> There is also a certain important truth in the Greek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>confusion, which has been too generally missed by modern critics
and statesmen—that the public is a great property-holder, and
that politics should be a business which requires the application of
the same economic and ethical laws as are admitted to govern in
private affairs.</p>

<p class='c002'>3. <i>Confusion of economics with ethics and politics.</i>—The assertion
that Greek economic theory was confounded with ethics and
politics has become a commonplace. The economic ideas of
Greek thinkers were not arrived at as a result of a purposeful study
of the problems of material wealth. All economic relations were
considered primarily from the standpoint of ethics and state
welfare. “The citizen was not regarded as a producer, but only
as a possessor of wealth.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Such statements are too commonly
accepted as a final criticism of Greek thinkers. Though the confusion
was a source of error, and caused Greek economic thought
to be one-sided and incomplete, yet some important considerations
should be noted.</p>

<p class='c002'><i>a</i>) The Socratic philosophers are our chief source for the economic
ideas of the Greeks. Too sweeping conclusions should not,
therefore, be drawn from them as to the general attitude of the
Greeks. Xenophon is much freer from the ethical emphasis than
the other Socratics. Thucydides is entirely free from it, and very
probably his standpoint came much nearer being that of the
average Athenian citizen.</p>

<p class='c002'><i>b</i>) The confusion was not merely with individual ethics, for
Greek moral philosophy always had the welfare of the state for
its goal. Indeed, the basal reason for this close union of economics,
ethics, and politics is the true idea that the state should rise above
internal strife, and unite all in a care for the common interest.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><i>c</i>) The standpoint of the Greek philosophers is certainly no
more to be criticized than is that of the so-called orthodox political
economy.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> They represent two extremes. If the Greek theory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>did not give to wealth its full right, and was open to the charge
of sentimentalism, the Ricardian doctrine, with its “economic
man,” which eliminated all other ideals and impulses, was an unreal
and pernicious abstraction. Of the two errors, the Greek is the
less objectionable, and is more in accord with the trend of economic
thought today. The best economists are now insisting more and
more on the Greek idea that economic problems must be considered
from the standpoint of the whole man as a citizen in society.
Modern political economy “has placed man as man and not
wealth in the foreground, and subordinated everything to his true
welfare.” “Love, generosity, nobility of character, self-sacrifice,
and all that is best and truest in our nature have their place in
economic life.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> “The science which deals with wealth, so far
from being a ‘gospel of Mammon,’ necessarily begins and ends
in the study of man.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> “Es soll kein Widerspruch zwischen
Ethik und Volkswirtschaft bestehen, es soll das Sittengesetz für
die Wirtschaft gelten und in ihr ausgeführt werden.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Such
strong statements taken at random from modern economists should
serve to temper our criticism of the Greek confusion. Plato’s
definition of economics, as suggested by one of the most recent
historians of economic thought,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a> could easily be accepted by many
a modern scholar: “Economics is the science which deals with the
satisfaction of human wants through exchange, seeking so to regulate
the industries of the state as to make its citizens good and
happy, and so to promote the highest well-being of the whole.”
The contention of the Socratics, that all economic operations must
finally root in the moral, that all economic problems are moral
problems, and that the province of economics is human welfare,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>is thus a dominant twentieth-century idea. And just as the
ethical interest of the Greek philosophers caused them to emphasize
the problems of distribution and consumption, so these are the
phases of economics that receive chief consideration today. To
be sure, modern thought appreciates more fully the complementary
truth that all our social and moral problems root essentially in
economic conditions, though this too was by no means overlooked
by Plato and Aristotle.</p>

<p class='c002'>4. <i>Ascetic tendency.</i>—It cannot be denied, however, that, as
a result of the overemphasis on the ethical, Greek economic thought
was hampered by a certain asceticism. But this was also an outgrowth
of pessimistic tendencies in Greek philosophy itself. Moreover,
the ascetic ideas of the philosophers cannot be accepted as
the common attitude of Athenian citizens, any more than Thoreau
can be recognized as a criterion of the economic thought of his day
in New England.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Asceticism was certainly foreign to the mind
of Pericles and Thucydides. In the course of our discussion, also,
we shall find that it represents, after all, only one phase of the
thought of the philosophers themselves.</p>

<p class='c002'>5. <i>Socialistic tendency.</i>—Since Greek economy was chiefly
interested in the problems of distribution, it tended toward socialism,
both in theory and in practice. This was also a natural outgrowth
of the fact that individual interests were subordinated to
public welfare. Though the latter half of the fifth century witnessed
a great individualistic movement in Greece, and though
individualism and independence are often named as prominent
Greek characteristics, yet these terms did not constitute a basal
political principle, even in the free Athenian democracy, in the
same sense as they do with us today. The life of the Greek citizen
was lived far more for the state, and was more absolutely at the
disposal of the state, than is true in any modern democracy. In
Greece, politics was thus the social science of first importance, and
the supreme purpose of all human activity was to make good
citizens. State interference or regulation was thus accepted as
a matter of course, and the setting of prices, rigid regulation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>grain commerce, exploitation of the rich in the interest of the poor,
and public ownership of great material interests such as mines
were not revolutionary ideas, but common facts in Greek life.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
The tendency of the theorists was therefore naturally toward
centralization of power in the hands of the state, and an exaggerated
idea of the omnipotence of law.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Yet despite the error
inherent in it, this socialistic tendency of Greek economic thought
had its basal truth, which is becoming an axiom of modern economics
and statesmanship—the belief that private property is
not a natural right, but a gift of society, and hence that its activities
should be controlled by society, and made to minister to public
welfare. Indeed, we have by no means escaped the error of the
Greek thinkers, for one of the most common mistakes of statesmen
and political theorists today is an overestimate of the effectiveness
of law.</p>

<p class='c006'>As stated above, the economic ideas of the Greeks were unsystematized and
inextensive.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The extant literature previous to

and importance of manual labor.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The contrast, however,
is not so great as it appears, for the labor which he dignifies is
agricultural. He constantly urges its importance as the chief
source of wealth.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a> On the other hand, he opposes the commercial
spirit that was beginning to be rife in his age, and decries the evil
of unjust gains.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a> His mention of the fact of competition between
artisans of the same trade is of interest for the development of
industry in Greece.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a> His <i>Erga</i> was, in a sense, the forerunner of
the later <i>Economica</i> in Greek literature.</p>

<p class='c002'>Solon proved by his reforms that he had some sane economic
ideas as to the importance of labor, industry, commerce, and
money in the development of the state. He also showed some
insight into the solution of the problem of poverty. His ideas,
however, are not definitely formulated in his extant fragments,
and belong rather to economic history.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a> The <i>Elegies</i> of Theognis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>are full of moral utterances on wealth, emphasizing its temporary

have often been given a prominent place in the history of communism,
but this is probably due to a false interpretation.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a> It is
likely, however, that he opposed the evils of luxury, and moralized
on the relation between wealth and virtue.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a> Democritus wrote
a work on agriculture.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a> Like the other philosophers, he taught
that happiness was to be sought in the gold of character, rather
than in material wealth.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a> To his mind, poverty and wealth alike
were but names for need and satiety (κόρου).<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a> Wealth without
understanding was not a safe possession, depending for its value
on right use.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a> The amassing of wealth by just means, however,
was good,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a> though unjust gains were always a source of evil.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
Excessive desire for wealth was worse than the most extreme
poverty.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a> It is possible also that Democritus held to a mild form
of the social contract theory of the origin of society.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Heraclitus
complained bitterly of the unwisdom of the masses and their
merely material view of life.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a> He made the common antithesis
between material and spiritual wealth,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a> and observed the fact that
gold is a universal medium of exchange.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a> Hippodamas of Miletus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and Phaleas of Chalcedon proposed new plans for the distribution
of wealth, but we have the barest outline of their theories from
Aristotle.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Their systems will be discussed in a following chapter.</p>

<p class='c002'>The Sophists, true to their character as philosophers of extreme
individualism, developed a new theory of the origin of society.
The already current term φύσις, “nature,” which had been accepted
as a sufficient reason for the state’s existence, was now opposed
to “law,” νόμος, as natural to artificial. The Sophists argued
that, in a primitive state of nature, perfect individualism was the
rule. Men did injustice without restraint. The weaker, however,
being in the majority, and finding it to their disadvantage to
compete with the strong, agreed neither to do nor to suffer injustice,
and constrained the stronger minority to co-operate in their
decision. Thus arose the social contract whereby nature gave up
its real instinct for an artificial convention (συνθήκη), and thus
society came into being.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a> The theory, at first, though untrue,
was not intended to be destructive of moral foundations, but was
opposed rather to the traditional idea of the laws of a state as the
“decrees of a divinely inspired lawgiver.”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a> In the hands of men
like Thrasymachus<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a> and Callicles,<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c010'><sup>[42]</sup></a> however, it became a means of
denying that the life according to nature was bound by any laws
which the strong need observe, and that might was the only final law.</p>

<p class='c002'>In line with their radical individualism, the Sophists were also
pioneers in the more cosmopolitan spirit that characterized the
Cynics and Stoics. They taught the doctrine of the fundamental
worth and relationship of men,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a> and thus, with the Cynics, started
the attack upon the theory that upheld slavery as a natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>institution.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c010'><sup>[44]</sup></a> Little further is known of their other social or economic
ideas. Protagoras wrote a work on “wages,” but it was probably
an argument relative to the acceptance of pay by Sophists.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c010'><sup>[45]</sup></a> In
any event, this fact that the Sophists were so ready to be enriched
through their lectures is clear evidence that their teaching on
wealth was not the negative doctrine of the other Greek philosophers.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c010'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
Prodicus seems to have scorned menial labor as
morally degrading, though he agreed with Hesiod in his doctrine
of the dignity of all work that is noble.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c010'><sup>[47]</sup></a> He emphasized the
necessity of labor in the production of material good,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c010'><sup>[48]</sup></a> and, like
Democritus, was the forerunner of the Socratics in his insistence
upon right use as a criterion of wealth.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c010'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Hippias prided himself on
his accomplishment in many arts,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c010'><sup>[50]</sup></a> and thus probably did not share
the prejudice of the philosophers against manual labor.</p>

<p class='c002'>Euripides, though markedly individualistic, like the Sophists,
shows traces of the older use of nature to explain the necessity
of the state. He draws a parallel between the social order and
the order of nature, by which law and government are justified,
and the right of the middle class of farmers to rule is upheld.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c010'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>He emphasizes the importance of agriculture, and the dignity of
the peasant farmer (αὐτουργός), who works his own land, as the
stay of the country.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c010'><sup>[52]</sup></a> This latter accords well with his cosmopolitan
spirit, which he shares with the Sophists. He opposes the artificial
distinctions of birth,<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c010'><sup>[53]</sup></a> slavery,<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c010'><sup>[54]</sup></a> and the traditional Greek
idea of the inferiority of woman.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c010'><sup>[55]</sup></a> His attitude toward wealth is
that of the moral philosopher rather than that of the Sophist.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c010'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Thucydides reveals considerable insight into economic problems,
though he does not deal with them directly. Roscher
declares that the Greek historian contributed as much as any
other writer to give him the elements of his science, since he alone,
of all Greek writers, did not confuse his economic ideas with ethics.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c010'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
He recognizes the place of labor in production, and the importance
of material wealth as the basis for all higher development.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c010'><sup>[58]</sup></a> He
also has some appreciation of the true nature of capital. In his
description of the undeveloped condition of early Greece, which
lived from hand to mouth, he writes like a modern economist
describing primitive conditions in Europe in contrast to the capitalism
of his own day.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c010'><sup>[59]</sup></a> Cornford’s attempt<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c010'><sup>[60]</sup></a> to discredit Thucydides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>as a historian, and to show that he missed the true cause, economic,
of the Peloponnesian War, is not convincing. Cornford both exaggerates
the influence of commercial interests in fifth-century Athens
and belittles the economic insight of Thucydides. The Greek
writer is, however, like Herodotus, a historical source for the actual
economic conditions in Greece, rather than an economic theorist.</p>

<p class='c002'>Aside from the fragmentary hints presented above, Greek
economic thought begins with the Socratics, Plato, Xenophon, and
Aristotle, and is continued, in a very incidental way, in the orators,
and in the Stoics and their contemporaries. As we shall see, however,
even in the Socratics, no real science of wealth is developed, in
the modern sense. The reason for this lack, which is most commonly
emphasized since it is closest at hand, is that the phenomena
of actual production were but slightly developed. This explanation
is well summarized by Haney<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c010'><sup>[61]</sup></a> as follows: (<i>a</i>) that economic relations
between individuals and states were far simpler than now;
(<i>b</i>) that international commerce was not encouraged by ancient
states, whose ideal was rather national exclusion; (<i>c</i>) that public
finance was then very limited and unimportant; (<i>d</i>) that division
of labor was not extensive; (<i>e</i>) that the relative lack of security
of life and property discouraged exchange and saving; (<i>f</i>) that in all
these respects, the situation is analogous to that of mediaeval
Europe.</p>

<p class='c002'>There is certainly much force in this general reason. The
development of economic thought must, of course, depend upon
the actual conditions under which the thinkers live. We have
already admitted also the vast difference between the present
economic complexity and the simplicity in ancient Greece. The
foregoing summary of Haney, however, is misleading. Though
the ideal of Sparta was national exclusion, it was surely not that
of Athens and some other Greek states. All extant records agree
that Athens, at least, the home of the economic theorists, encouraged
international commerce by every means in her power. The
division of labor, while insignificant compared with the minute
division of modern mechanical industry, was by no means inextensive,
as is evidenced by the fact that this is a point on which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Greek thinkers show especial insight. The notion that Greek
industry was chiefly limited to household economy, and that the
era of capitalism had not yet dawned, has long ago been refuted
by Meyer and others. The alleged insecurity of life and property,
while relatively true, is exaggerated for Athens, at least. Above
all, the common attempt to draw an analogy between classical
Greece and mediaeval Europe economically is due to an utter
misconception. The period of Greek economic history, which
corresponds to that of the Middle Ages, is rather the era of economic
awakening, between the middle of the ninth and the end
of the sixth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c010'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Other reasons for the limited development of Greek economic
thought are:</p>

<p class='c002'><i>a</i>) The dominance of the state over the individual citizen,
which fact caused political rather than economic speculation to
absorb the attention of Greek thinkers. It is stated that the
importance of the individual must be recognized before a science
of economics can develop.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c010'><sup>[63]</sup></a> This reason is also usually overemphasized.</p>

<p class='c002'><i>b</i>) The general prejudice in Greece against industry, labor for
another, and finance for its own sake. That such a prejudice
existed to some degree, arising from the old aristocratic feeling,
moral objections, the reflex influence of slavery, the spirit of independence,
and the belief that leisure was necessary for the proper
performance of the duties of citizenship, is generally admitted.
The commonly assumed universality of this feeling is, however,
open to grave question. The prejudice against skilled labor was
probably limited to the moral philosophers, and perhaps to the
more aristocratic portion of the citizens, and we shall see in another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>chapter that the hostile attitude of the philosophers themselves
has been considerably exaggerated. The evil effects of slavery
also could not have been so marked in Greece, before the age of
machinery. Moreover, as Meyer has pointed out, a prejudice
against manual labor is evident among the more favored classes in
most European countries today, yet it does not appear to retard
the advance of industry in the least.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c010'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><i>c</i>) The approval of conquest as a legitimate source of wealth.
This is somewhat true as applied to the state, but it certainly is
irrelevant for the individual citizen of fifth-century Athens. To
appeal to Aristotle’s list of legitimate employments as evidence
of this is to misinterpret his meaning, for he is thinking of a primitive
life, not of contemporary Greece.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c010'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><i>d</i>) Economic facts are a commonplace of daily life, and familiarity
breeds contempt.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c010'><sup>[66]</sup></a> This statement contradicts the first reason
given by Haney. Moreover, it is somewhat unfortunate as applied
to Greece, since the very opposite reason is given for the prominence
of political speculation—the commonness of practical politics.</p>

<p class='c002'><i>e</i>) Perhaps the strongest reason for the comparative unimportance
of Greek economic thought is usually not emphasized.
It is the patent fact that almost our only extant sources are the
Socratic philosophers, who represent avowedly a direct moral
reaction against the commercial spirit and money-greed of their
age.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c010'><sup>[67]</sup></a> Thus the limited development of Greek economics, so far
from being an evidence of primitive economic conditions in Greece,
is a direct argument for the opposite. To be sure, a man with the
scientific mind of Aristotle would scarcely have failed to gain
a clearer apprehension of certain fundamentals of economics than
he did, had his economic environment been more complex. Yet
the fact remains that he and Plato are moral prophets, protesting
against that very capitalism whose existence many modern historians
have sought to deny to their age.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>
  <h2 id='chap3' class='c005' title='III. Plato'>CHAPTER III <br /> PLATO</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>As seen above, Plato was the first great economic thinker of
Greece.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c010'><sup>[68]</sup></a> Plato, however, was primarily interested in neither
economics nor politics, but in moral idealism. He is pre-eminent,
even among the Socratics, for this. All his economic thought is
a direct outgrowth of it, and is shot through with its influence.
Yet, despite this fact, he exhibits considerable insight into some
of the basal principles of economics,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c010'><sup>[69]</sup></a> and his entire <i>Republic</i> is
founded upon an essentially economic theory of society. He
traces its origin to mutual need,<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c010'><sup>[70]</sup></a> and makes little of the innate
social impulse, so prominent in Aristotle’s analysis.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c010'><sup>[71]</sup></a> He is the
predecessor of Aristotle, however, in opposing the social contract
doctrine of the Sophists with its interpretation of law as mere
convention, by a natural theory of social origins. To his thought,
the very foundations of society are established in eternal justice.
They are not the result of mere convention, nor altogether the
work of inspired lawgivers, but a complex product of natural and
artificial elements.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c010'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>VALUE</h3>
<p class='c006'>Strictly speaking, Plato’s contribution to a theory of economic
value and a definition of wealth is practically nil. In his discussion
of just price, he merely hints at the fact of exchange value.
He implies that, since goods exchange according to definite proportions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>they should have a common quality capable of measurement,
and that just price corresponds to this.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c010'><sup>[73]</sup></a> He offers no suggestion
as to the nature of this quality, except that, in stating
that “the artisan knows what the value of his product is,” he
seems to be thinking of labor, or cost of production, as the chief
element in value.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c010'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>In other passages, he insists on the doctrine taught previously
by Democritus,<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c010'><sup>[75]</sup></a> and later by Xenophon and other philosophers,
that so-called goods depend for their value upon the ability of the
possessor to use them rightly.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c010'><sup>[76]</sup></a> This idea is represented in modern
thought especially by Ruskin.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c010'><sup>[77]</sup></a> The theory is, of course, true of
absolute value, and, in a sense, even of economic value, in that
“all exchangeableness of a commodity depends upon the sum of
capacity for its use.”<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c010'><sup>[78]</sup></a> It cannot be made a criterion of economic
value, though the allied idea, implied by Plato and urged by
Ruskin, that the innate quality of the thing, its capacity for good
or harm, is a real element in economic value, is being recognized
today. This is evident in the increasing hostility toward such
so-called commodities as opium and intoxicating liquors. Since
we have begun to define political economy in terms of human life
rather than in terms of property, Ruskin’s definition of wealth is
more acceptable: “the things which the nature of humanity has
rendered in all ages, and must render in all ages to come ...
the objects of legitimate desire.”<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c010'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>WEALTH</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Plato has much to say of wealth, though he deals with it strictly
from the standpoint of the moralist. We look in vain for a clear
definition, or for a consistent distinction of economic wealth from
other goods. His terms are πλοῦτος, used of both material and
spiritual wealth; χρήματα, often interpreted literally of “useful
things,” as the basis of the subjective doctrine of value discussed
above; κτήματα, “possessions,” and such words as χρυσός and
ἀργύριον. His use of these terms, especially the first, is ambiguous.
At times he means material goods only; again, like Ruskin, he
includes every human good, intellectual and moral as well;<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c010'><sup>[80]</sup></a> again
he means “excessive wealth.”<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c010'><sup>[81]</sup></a> As a result of his conception of
value, he includes in material wealth all those objects that depend
for their worth upon wise use and character in the possessor.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c010'><sup>[82]</sup></a>
Material wealth is regularly placed last by Plato, as inferior to all
other goods of soul or body, a mere means, and not an end in itself,<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c010'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
for virtue does not come from property, but property and all other
goods from virtue.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c010'><sup>[84]</sup></a> Material goods should be the last thing in
one’s thought,<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c010'><sup>[85]</sup></a> and the fact that people universally put them first
is the cause of many ills to state and individual alike.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c010'><sup>[86]</sup></a> Wealth
is not blind, if only it follows wisdom.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c010'><sup>[87]</sup></a> The things usually called
goods are not rightly so named, unless the possessor be just and
worthy.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c010'><sup>[88]</sup></a> To the base, on the other hand, they are the greatest
evil.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c010'><sup>[89]</sup></a> In all of this, Plato is the forerunner of Ruskin, with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>characteristic assertions: “Only so much as one can use is wealth,
beyond that is illth”; and “Wealth depends also on vital power in
the possessor.”<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c010'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Plato especially inveighs against excessive wealth and luxury.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c010'><sup>[91]</sup></a>
Men are urged not to lay up riches for their children, since great
wealth is of no use to them or the state.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c010'><sup>[92]</sup></a> The prime object of
good legislation should not be, as is commonly supposed, to make
the state as rich as possible,<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c010'><sup>[93]</sup></a> since excessive wealth and luxury
decrease productive efficiency,<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c010'><sup>[94]</sup></a> are incompatible with the highest
character or happiness, being based on both unjust acquisition
(κτῆσις) and unjust expenditure (ἀναλώματα),<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c010'><sup>[95]</sup></a> produce degeneration
in individual and nation,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c010'><sup>[96]</sup></a> and are the direct cause of war<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c010'><sup>[97]</sup></a> and
civic strife.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c010'><sup>[98]</sup></a> Were it feasible, he would prefer to go back to the
simpler life of earlier times, before luxury and the inordinate
desire for riches had so dominated all society.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c010'><sup>[99]</sup></a> Of course he
realizes that such a return is impossible, but he has little hope
of any other escape from the evils. He is thus led to express the
belief that the fewer wants the better, a doctrine common also
to Ruskin, Carlyle, and Thoreau.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c010'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>However, Plato has no prejudice against moderate wealth.
His sermons are directed against excessive commercialism, which
puts money before the human interest,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c010'><sup>[101]</sup></a> thereby causing injustice,
degenerate luxury, vicious extremes of wealth and poverty, political
graft, individual inefficiency, and wars both within and without
the state. Though his philosophy leads to asceticism, and his
attitude toward wealth seems, on the surface, to breathe this spirit,
yet Plato is not an ascetic in his doctrine of wealth, as is often
wrongly asserted. He describes the true attitude as that which
partakes of both pleasures and pains, not shunning, but mastering
them.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c010'><sup>[102]</sup></a> He recognizes an assured competency to be practically
a prerequisite for the development of the good life,<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c010'><sup>[103]</sup></a> while, on the
other hand, he considers poverty to be an evil only second to
excessive wealth.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c010'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>To be sure, Plato’s demand for a limitation of private and
national wealth, and his general negative attitude are, if interpreted
rigidly, unfruitful and economically impossible.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c010'><sup>[105]</sup></a> It is not
business that should be curbed, but bad business.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c010'><sup>[106]</sup></a> Individual or
nation cannot become too prosperous, provided there is a proper
distribution and a wise consumption of wealth, and Plato’s idea
that great prosperity is incompatible with this goal can hardly be
accepted by modern economists.</p>

<p class='c002'>Nevertheless, there is much of abiding truth in his doctrine of
wealth. Aside from the profound moral value of his main contention,
we may state summarily several points in which he remarkably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>anticipated the thought of the more modern humanitarian
economists: (1) in the fact that excessive private wealth is practically
impossible without corresponding extremes of poverty, and
that such a condition is a most fruitful cause of dissension in any
state; (2) in the fact that extremes of wealth or poverty cause industrial
inefficiency; (3) in the prevalent belief that no man can gain
great wealth by just acquisition, since, even though he may have
done no conscious injustice, his excessive accumulation has been due
to unjust social conditions; (4) in the growing belief that expenditures
of great private fortunes are not likely to be helpful either
to individual or to community, but are too liable to be marked by
foolish luxury and waste that saps the vitality of the nation; to
Plato, such are mere drone consumers of the store (τῶν ἑτοίμων
ἀναλωτής, ... κηφήν);<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c010'><sup>[107]</sup></a> in this, he was a forerunner of Ruskin,
who opposed the old popular fallacy that the expenditures of the
wealthy, of whatever nature, benefit the poor;<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c010'><sup>[108]</sup></a> (5) in the dominant
note in economic thought today, so emphasized by Plato and
Ruskin, that the prime goal of the science is human life at its best—as
Ruskin states it, “the producing as many as possible full-breathed,
bright-eyed, and happy-hearted human creatures”;<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c010'><sup>[109]</sup></a>
(6) in the fact that the national demand for unlimited wealth is
now recognized, as Plato taught, always to have been the most
fruitful cause of international differences; (7) in the fact, which
is receiving ever-greater recognition by modern economists and
statesmen, that the innate quality of the object for good or harm
must be considered in a true definition of economic wealth.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c010'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>PRODUCTION</h3>
<p class='c006'>Plato seems to have had little positive interest in the problems
of production. He was too much engrossed with suggesting means
for limiting excessive acquisition. He was, however, quite apt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>in his use of illustrations from industrial life.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c010'><sup>[111]</sup></a> He was also apparently
the first to give a real classification of trades,<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c010'><sup>[112]</sup></a> as follows:
furnishers of raw materials (πρωτογενὲς εἶδος), makers of tools
(ὅργανα), makers of vessels for conserving products (ἀγγεῖα),
makers of vehicles (ὅχημα), manufacturers of clothing and means
of defense (προβλήματα), workers in fine arts (παίγνιον), producers
of food (θρέμμα)—a fairly inclusive catalogue for that age; if commerce
and the learned professions were included. But some of the
classes overlap, since they follow no necessary principle of division.
He divided productive arts into co-operative (συναιτίους), which
provide tools for manufacture, and principal (ἀιτίας), which produce
the objects themselves.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c010'><sup>[113]</sup></a> They were further divided into
productive arts (ποιητικαί), which bring something new into
existence, and acquisitive (κτητικαί), which merely gain what already
exists. In the latter class, he placed all commerce, science, and
hunting.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c010'><sup>[114]</sup></a> Plato would thus appear to exclude commerce and the
learned professions from the true sphere of production. This,
however, is only apparent, in so far as legitimate exchange is concerned.
He clearly understood that the merchant and retailer
save the time of the other workers,<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c010'><sup>[115]</sup></a> and that they perform a real
service to the community, in that they make necessary exchange
convenient and possible.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c010'><sup>[116]</sup></a> He thus recognized them as producers
of a time and place value, and he cannot be accused of the physiocratic
error, which denied productivity to all workers except those
who produce directly from natural resources.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c010'><sup>[117]</sup></a> His distinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>of productive and acquisitive arts can, furthermore, hardly be
interpreted as intending to limit production to the material merely,
though learning is relegated to the acquisitive class. Such an
interpretation would be out of harmony with the whole trend of
his thought.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c010'><sup>[118]</sup></a> His further classification of productive agencies
as creative (ἕνεκα τοῦ ποιεῖν τι) or preventive (τοῦ μὴ πάσχειν)<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c010'><sup>[119]</sup></a> substantiates
this, for many of the preventive agencies are intellectual
and scientific.</p>

<p class='c002'>The general attitude of Plato toward economic production may
be inferred from his insistence upon the thorough application of
the division of labor for the perfection of industry.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c010'><sup>[120]</sup></a> He evidently
recognized it as the necessary basis of all higher life. We have
seen above, also that one of his chief objections to excessive wealth
or poverty was the fact that they caused inefficiency in production.</p>

<p class='c002'><i>Agriculture.</i>—Of the three factors that enter into production—land,
labor, and capital—the most important in the mind of the
Greek thinkers was land. The relative prominence of agriculture
was partly the cause of this, but in the case of the philosophers,
their ethical passion, their idea of the necessity of leisure for
personal development, and their conservative attitude toward
industry and commerce were the chief motives that impelled them
to urge their contemporaries back to the simple life of the farm.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c010'><sup>[121]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The aristocratic feeling, still strong in European countries, that
landed property is the most respectable, probably also had some
influence, though land was not so distinctively in the hands of the
upper classes in Attica.</p>

<p class='c002'>Though the praise of agriculture was a characteristic feature
of Greek literature in all periods, it was not at first a conscious
economic theory.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c010'><sup>[122]</sup></a> Later, toward the end of the fifth century, it
became a definite ethico-economic doctrine of the philosophers,
as a criticism of their times, and as an appeal to what was deemed
to be the more healthful life of the earlier days.</p>

<p class='c002'>Plato does not devote so much attention to this theme as do
Xenophon and Aristotle. His standpoint, however, is practically
the same, though his tendency toward the physiocratic error is not
so marked. In his second state, he orders that agriculture shall
be the only means of money-making,<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c010'><sup>[123]</sup></a> and he even strikes the
modern note of conservation, in his directions for the care of
land, waters, springs, and forests.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c010'><sup>[124]</sup></a> On this point, he and the
other Greek thinkers accord well with the economy of the past
decade with its urgent preachment, “Back to the land,” though
the modern watchword has, of course, a more economic emphasis.</p>

<p class='c002'><i>Capital.</i>—Though the function of capital, aside from natural
resources, was a familiar fact in the Athenian life of the fifth and
fourth centuries <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>,<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c010'><sup>[125]</sup></a> there is scarcely any consideration of it by
the theorists before Aristotle. Plato has no definition of capital,
nor indeed scarcely any recognition of the fact of its existence.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c010'><sup>[126]</sup></a>
His emphasis on the virtue of economy, however, and his criticism
of those who spend the “stored wealth,” imply the idea that wealth
should be used not merely for enjoyment, but also for productive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>purposes.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c010'><sup>[127]</sup></a> His strictures upon interest show that he has but
slight appreciation of the productive function of money-capital.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c010'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><i>Labor and industry.</i>—On the other hand, Plato has considerable
insight into the rôle of labor in production. To be sure, he shares
with the other philosophers a certain prejudice against manual
labor as degrading to freemen.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c010'><sup>[129]</sup></a> The mechanical arts call forth
reproach.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c010'><sup>[130]</sup></a> Free citizens should not be burdened with such ignoble
occupations,<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c010'><sup>[131]</sup></a> and any person who disobeys this rule shall lose his
civic rights until he gives up his trade.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c010'><sup>[132]</sup></a> Agriculture alone shall be
open to them, and only so much of this as will not cause them to
neglect their higher welfare.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c010'><sup>[133]</sup></a> However, this prejudice has been
read into some passages in Plato by a forced interpretation. The
assertion of Socrates,<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c010'><sup>[134]</sup></a> that craftsmen have not temperance (σωφροσύνη),
since they do other people’s business, is made merely to
draw Critias into the argument. The statement that all arts
having for their function provision for the body are slavish,<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c010'><sup>[135]</sup></a> does
not necessarily imply prejudice against physical labor. Such
arts are slavish, to Plato, because they have no definite principle
of service as gymnastics has. He is merely illustrating the point
that it is an inferior type of statesmanship that works without
a definite principle for the highest political welfare. The idea,
expressed in the <i>Politics</i>,<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c010'><sup>[136]</sup></a> that the masses (πλῆθος) cannot acquire
political science is a criticism against unprepared statesmanship
rather than against labor. Indeed, Plato asserts the same of the
wealthy.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c010'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Moreover, the following facts should be observed: that the
prejudice of Plato against the manual arts is chiefly limited to the
<i>Laws</i>; that even there his prejudice is primarily against retail
trade rather than against industry;<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c010'><sup>[138]</sup></a> that in so far as a real hostility
exists, its true source is not in any opposition to labor or industry
<i>per se</i>, but rather in the political belief that only as citizens have
leisure for politics can prepared statesmen take the place of superficial
politicians,<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c010'><sup>[139]</sup></a> and in the moral feeling that constant devotion
merely to the physical necessities of life causes men to neglect the
primary purpose of their existence.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c010'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Modern scholars have usually been extreme in their interpretation
of Plato on this point.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c010'><sup>[141]</sup></a> Such unwarranted generalizations
as the following are common: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Il ne découvre dans les professions
qui tendent au lucre qu’égoisme, bassesse d’esprit, dégradation
des sentiments.” “Platon et Aristote voient dans le commerce et
dans l’industrie deux plaies de la société; ils voudraient les extirper
à’fond, si cela était possible.”</span><a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c010'><sup>[142]</sup></a> One of the worst misinterpretations
has been perpetrated by Roscher, in inferring from the <i>Republic</i>
(372 ff.) that Plato <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“das Leben der Gewerbetreibenden als ein
Leben thierischen Behaglichkeit schildert, sie wohl mit Schweinen
vergleicht.”</span><a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c010'><sup>[143]</sup></a> Such absurdities are unfortunately not rare, though
they might be avoided by a careful reading, even in a translation.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c010'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>It should not be overlooked either that Plato’s utterances on
labor are by no means all negative. Skilled labor is recognized
in several of the minor dialogues as fulfilling an actual need in
civilization. Laborers are represented as having their part in
knowledge and virtue,<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c010'><sup>[145]</sup></a> and are admitted to be the necessary
foundation of all human well-being.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c010'><sup>[146]</sup></a> A positive interest is also
manifested by Plato in labor and the proper development of the
arts in both the <i>Republic</i> and the <i>Laws</i>. He constantly harps on
the necessity of each doing his fitting work, and doing it well, and
in his opinion happiness consists in this rather than in idleness.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c010'><sup>[147]</sup></a>
Indeed, that each one perform well the task for which nature has
fitted him is the definition of justice itself.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c010'><sup>[148]</sup></a> The indolent rich
man is a parasite and a drone, a disease of the state. This is
Plato’s favorite figure in both the <i>Republic</i> and the <i>Laws</i>, a figure
that is suggestive of Hesiod, the pioneer champion of labor.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c010'><sup>[149]</sup></a> He
is even ready to admit that it is, after all, not the kind of labor
but the character of the workman that ennobles or degrades any
work.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c010'><sup>[150]</sup></a> In fine, his attitude toward the mechanical arts is similar
to that of Ruskin, who also thinks that manual labor is degrading.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c010'><sup>[151]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>But as with Plato, the chief secret of his prejudice lies in the fact
that laborers usually do their work mechanically, without thought.
He believes that “workmen ought often to be thinking, and thinkers
ought often to be working.” He is willing to classify all work
as liberal on this basis, the only distinction being the amount of
skill required.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c010'><sup>[152]</sup></a> However, in agreement with Plato’s idea, he
would set the roughest and least intellectual to the roughest work,
and this he thinks to be “the best of charities” to them.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c010'><sup>[153]</sup></a> With
Plato, he is also convinced that, under actual conditions of labor,
the degradation is very difficult to avoid, and therefore he would
emphasize chiefly agricultural labor, where education of head and
hand are more fully realized.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c010'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It is, however, in Plato’s constant insistence upon the principle
of the division of labor, as a prerequisite for any success in the
mechanical arts or elsewhere, that he reveals insight into, and
interest in, productive labor. This is the basal idea in the <i>Republic</i>.
It is also one of the chief regulations in the <i>Laws</i>, where its direct
application to the artisan is a clear evidence that he appreciates
the economic significance of the principle.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c010'><sup>[155]</sup></a> To him, it is the
foundation of all human development. Society finds its source in
mutual need (ἡ ἡμετέρα χρεία). Man is not self-sufficient (αὐτάρκης).
Reciprocity is necessary even in the most primitive state.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c010'><sup>[156]</sup></a> Out of
this necessary dependence arises the division of labor, a beneficent
law, “since the product is larger, better, and more easily produced,
whenever one man gives up all other business, and does one thing
fitting to his nature, and at the opportune time.”<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c010'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>The basis of this law Plato finds in the fact of the diversity of
natures, which fits men for different tasks.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c010'><sup>[158]</sup></a> In this he differs from
Adam Smith, who believes that the differences of natural talents
in men are much less than is generally supposed. Smith makes the
propensity to barter the source of specialization, which, in turn, is
based on the interdependence of men. He thus considers the
diversities in human nature to be the effect rather than the cause
of the division of labor.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c010'><sup>[159]</sup></a> Plato, however, is probably nearer the
truth, since the very reason for mutual interdependence is diversity
of nature.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c010'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The advantages of specialization, according to Plato,<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c010'><sup>[161]</sup></a> are four,
as stated above. It enables one to accomplish more work with
greater ease, more skilfully, and at the proper season. The second
and fourth of these are not mentioned by Adam Smith, but he notes
the resulting increase in opulence for all the people, and the development
of inventive genius. He also observes that the division of
labor causes the growth of capital, and that this in turn increases
specialization.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c010'><sup>[162]</sup></a> Of course Plato could not appreciate the important
fact of the influence of the division of labor on the development of
inventive genius, since he lived before the age of machinery.</p>

<p class='c002'>Plato is also a forerunner of Adam Smith in his recognition of
the fact that the division of labor depends for its advance upon
a great increase in the size and complexity of the state.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c010'><sup>[163]</sup></a> It means
a multiplication of trades, a development of industry,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c010'><sup>[164]</sup></a> the entrance
of the retail trader (κάπηλος),<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c010'><sup>[165]</sup></a> and the invention of money as a means
of exchange.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c010'><sup>[166]</sup></a> The necessity of the division of labor between
states is also recognized. It is impossible to establish a city where
it will not be in need of imports (ἐπεισαγωγίμων). International
trade therefore arises, and with it are born the merchant (ἔμπορος)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and the sailor class, together with all those who are engaged in
the labor of the carrying trade.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c010'><sup>[167]</sup></a> Thus Plato, the idealist, and
reputed enemy of trade and industry, develops them directly out
of the basal principle of his <i>Republic</i>. He appreciates the necessity
of a full-fledged industry and commerce to the existence even of
a primitive state, and his hostility to them is actually directed
only against what he terms their unnatural use.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c010'><sup>[168]</sup></a> Moreover, in
his opinion, one function of the division of labor should be to limit
them to the performance of their proper tasks, and keep them from
degenerating into mere money-making devices. It should also
result in limiting such vocations to the less capable classes since
the rulers should be artisans of freedom.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c010'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It would take us too far afield to discuss the diverse ways in
which Plato uses his principle. We may observe in passing,
however, that he applies it to war, in his interesting criticism of
the citizen-soldier;<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c010'><sup>[170]</sup></a> to the finer arts, even when they are quite
similar to each other;<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c010'><sup>[171]</sup></a> to politics, as noted above; to justice and
the moral life in general;<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c010'><sup>[172]</sup></a> and to the intellectual life, in his unsparing
criticism of the superficial versatility and dilettantism of the
contemporary Athenian democracy, which trusts the government
to any incompetent, professes to be able to imitate everything, and
makes the many-sided Sophist (πολλαπλοῦς) the man of the hour.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c010'><sup>[173]</sup></a>
Though he begins with the development of the principle as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>economic fact, his primary interest in it is as a moral and
intellectual maxim. The fact that the cobbler sticks to his last
is only a symbol (εἴδωλον) of justice.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c010'><sup>[174]</sup></a> Nevertheless Plato does
appreciate to a remarkable degree the economic bearings of the
law, and his discussion of it is notably scientific and complete.<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c010'><sup>[175]</sup></a>
He sometimes pushes its application to an extreme, though such
instances are perhaps meant in a playful Socratic vein.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c010'><sup>[176]</sup></a> At least,
like Ruskin, he understands that extreme specialization must
produce narrow and one-sided men, and that progress revolts
against its too rigid application.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c010'><sup>[177]</sup></a> He is aware too that the division
of labor breaks down in the case of the poor unemployed of the
state, since they have no special work.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c010'><sup>[178]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>SLAVERY</h3>
<p class='c006'>Plato is not blind to the ethical aspects of the problem of slavery.
In his first healthy state (ὑγιείνη), slavery and war are conspicuously
absent, and it is the natural inference that the author believed
these to be necessary evils of the more complex state.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c010'><sup>[179]</sup></a> He appreciates
the dangers of absolute power, even in private life, and
believes that few men can stand the strain.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c010'><sup>[180]</sup></a> He conceives human
nature as a unity that defies absolute division into separate classes.<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c010'><sup>[181]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Though he does not renounce slavery in the <i>Republic</i>, he would
limit, it to the barbarians and to those who seem unfit for the higher
life.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c010'><sup>[182]</sup></a> It plays a remarkably small part in his first state, and it
would seem that his idealism is here struggling against what he
feels to be an economic necessity. In the <i>Laws</i>, he frankly accepts
the necessity, and puts even agriculture, as well as the other
industries, into the hands of slaves.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c010'><sup>[183]</sup></a> However, they are not to
be treated as animals, but as rational men, in whom a proper usage
may develop a certain degree of morality and ambition for good
work.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c010'><sup>[184]</sup></a> To be sure, his purpose is economic rather than ethical—to
make the slaves satisfied with their lot, and thus better producers.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c010'><sup>[185]</sup></a>
He makes no mention of freedom as a reward for good
behavior, though he elsewhere provides for the existence of freedmen
in the state, and stipulates that they shall not become richer
than their former masters.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c010'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>MONEY</h3>
<p class='c006'>As Plato was the first of extant Greek thinkers to grasp the
principle of the division of labor, so he was the first to give any
hint as to the origin of money. He states that it came into use by
reason of the growth of necessary exchange, which in turn resulted
from increased division of labor.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c010'><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The function of money he defines somewhat indefinitely by the
term “token of exchange,”<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c010'><sup>[188]</sup></a> an expression suggestive of Ruskin’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>definition “a ticket or token of right to goods.”<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c010'><sup>[189]</sup></a> It seems to
imply that money is not itself a commodity to be trafficked in.
In the Laws, he specifies more clearly the functions of this symbol.
It acts as a medium of exchange and as a measure of value.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c010'><sup>[190]</sup></a> The
latter office is performed by reason of the fact that money is a
common denominator of value, changing products from incommensurable
(ἀσύμμετρον) and uneven (ἀνώμαλον) to commensurable
and even.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c010'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Since Plato did not consider money to be a commodity to be
bought and sold, and since he did not appreciate its productive
function as representative capital, his theory of interest was superficial.
His attitude toward it was somewhat similar to that of
many people today toward speculation in futures in the stock
market, as a practice contrary to public interest and policy. The
application of the term τόκος to interest by Plato<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c010'><sup>[192]</sup></a> and Aristotle,
as though interest were the direct child of money, is probably only
a punning etymology, and not intended seriously. It can therefore
hardly be used, as it often is, to prove the superficiality of the
theory of the Socratics. Plato, however, would have no money-making
by usury,<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c010'><sup>[193]</sup></a> nor indeed any loaning or credit at all, except
as an act of friendship.<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c010'><sup>[194]</sup></a> Such contracts should be made at the
loaner’s own risk,<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c010'><sup>[195]</sup></a> and held legal only as a punishment for breaking
other contracts.<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c010'><sup>[196]</sup></a> He calls the usurer a bee that inserts his sting,
money, into his victims, thereby beggaring them and enriching
himself.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c010'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Such strictures against interest were common in mediaeval
Europe, reappeared in Ruskin,<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c010'><sup>[198]</sup></a> and are implied in the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>opposition, in some quarters, to so-called “unearned income.”<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c010'><sup>[199]</sup></a>
The motive in mediaeval times, however, was distinctively religious,
and was also partly due to the absence of a developed capitalism.
With Ruskin and modern theorists, on the other hand, the
objection is, at bottom, socialistic. The motive of the Socratics
was essentially moral and political.</p>

<p class='c002'>Plato’s other error concerning money, as above observed, was
that it need possess no intrinsic value for domestic use. He looked
upon gold and silver as causes of degeneration in state and individual,<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c010'><sup>[200]</sup></a>
and would therefore have put a ban on them for use within
the state.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c010'><sup>[201]</sup></a> To his mind, a mere state fiat was sufficient to give
currency and value.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c010'><sup>[202]</sup></a> This doctrine has also often recurred in the
history of economic thought, as in Ruskin and the Greenback
party of a generation ago.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c010'><sup>[203]</sup></a> The error, however, was not so grave
in Plato’s case, for he, at least, recognized the need of the precious
metals for international purposes.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c010'><sup>[204]</sup></a> Moreover, in his proposed
state of such limited extent, the problem would have been far
simpler, and he would have distinguished between actual conditions
and possibilities in Greece and his admittedly more or less
utopian ideal.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>EXCHANGE</h3>
<p class='c006'>Exchange in Greek economy held a very minor place, compared
with its dominant importance in modern theory. It was discussed
chiefly in a negative manner, as the object of the moral and
aristocratic prejudice of Greek thinkers. We find, however, some
appreciation of its true place in the economic life of a state. Plato
divides trade, ἀλλαγή or ἀγοραστική, into αὐτοπωλική, which sells
its own products, αὐτουργῶν, and μεταβλητική, which exchanges
the products of others. He further divides the latter into καπηλική,
the exchange within the state, which he calls one-half of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>exchange, and ἐμπορική, foreign commerce.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c010'><sup>[205]</sup></a> He finds its origin
in the division of labor, and in the mutual interdependence of men
and states.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c010'><sup>[206]</sup></a> He understands the necessity of the reciprocal attitude
in international, as well as in private, exchange, and thus has
a clearer insight than the mercantilists and some modern statesmen.
A state must raise a surplus of its own products, so as to supply the
other state from which it expects to have its own needs satisfied.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c010'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Since a tariff on imports played little part in Greek life, except
in so far as it was imposed for sumptuary or war purposes,<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c010'><sup>[208]</sup></a> the perplexing
modern problem of the protective tariff scarcely came
within the horizon of Greek thinkers. Plato would prohibit the
import of certain luxuries, as a moral safeguard. He divides
merchandise into primary and secondary products, and would not
permit the import of the latter.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c010'><sup>[209]</sup></a> Elsewhere, however, he legislates
against imposts upon either imports or exports, though unconscious
of the significance of his suggestion.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c010'><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>He appreciated something of the function of exchange in
society. It performed a very important service, as a mediator
between producer and consumer.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c010'><sup>[211]</sup></a> Like money, it served to
equalize values, and thus acted as an aid to the satisfaction of
needs.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c010'><sup>[212]</sup></a> When limited to this primary function, it was of advantage
to both parties to the exchange,<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c010'><sup>[213]</sup></a> and merchants and retailers
had then a real part in the production of values.<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c010'><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The sweeping assertion is too often made that the Greek people
were hostile to trade, and therefore that their theorists were especially
opposed to it. We have already seen how false this idea is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>for the Greeks themselves,<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c010'><sup>[215]</sup></a> but it also needs a great deal of qualification
in the case of their writers. Their hostility is directed
especially against the more petty business of retail trade (καπηλική)
rather than against the extensive operations of the merchant
(ἔμπορος). But their opposition even to this is not entirely undiscriminating.
We have seen that Plato clearly understands the
necessity of exchange to the life of the state.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c010'><sup>[216]</sup></a> He admits that
even retail trade is not necessarily evil.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c010'><sup>[217]</sup></a> The chief reason why it
appears so is because it gives free opportunity for the vulgar greed
of unlimited gain, which is innate in man.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c010'><sup>[218]</sup></a> If the noblest citizens,
who are governed by rational interests, should become retailers
and innkeepers, the business would soon be held in honor.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c010'><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Plato, however, would limit exchange to its primary function
as defined above.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c010'><sup>[220]</sup></a> Like Ruskin, he believes that, whenever it is
pursued merely for private gain, it becomes a source of degeneration
to individual and state. It is then akin to the fraudulent or
counterfeit pursuits (κιβδήλοις).<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c010'><sup>[221]</sup></a> The retailers in well-ordered
states are generally the weakest men, who are unable to undertake
other work.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c010'><sup>[222]</sup></a> The rulers in the <i>Republic</i> must keep themselves
entirely free from the trammels of trade, lest they become wolves
instead of shepherds,<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c010'><sup>[223]</sup></a> though Plato is grappling here with a very
real problem that still faces us—how to prevent graft among
public servants.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c010'><sup>[224]</sup></a> In the <i>Laws</i>, retail trade is entirely prohibited
to citizens,<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c010'><sup>[225]</sup></a> and permitted only to metics and strangers,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c010'><sup>[226]</sup></a> and,
indeed, only to those whose corruption will be of least injury to the
state.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c010'><sup>[227]</sup></a> These aliens are not to be permitted to gain overmuch
wealth,<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c010'><sup>[228]</sup></a> and they must depart from the state, after twenty years’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>residence, with all their belongings.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c010'><sup>[229]</sup></a> Retail trade, even in their
hands, must be strictly limited to the demands of the state,<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c010'><sup>[230]</sup></a> and
confined to the market-place for the sake of publicity.<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c010'><sup>[231]</sup></a> All
exchange must be honest, dealing with unadulterated products
(ἀκίβδηλον).<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c010'><sup>[232]</sup></a> There shall be no dickering over sales, but only one
price shall be set upon goods each day. If this is not accepted, the
goods must be removed from sale until the following day.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c010'><sup>[233]</sup></a> If
possible, the executors of the laws should try to fix a just schedule
of prices, to allow of moderate gain, and should see that this is
observed by the retailers.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c010'><sup>[234]</sup></a> As a climax to all these precautions,
Plato would have the rulers take pains to devise means whereby
the retailers shall not degenerate into unbridled shamelessness
and meanness of soul.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c010'><sup>[235]</sup></a> Under such limitations, he has faint hopes
that retail trade may be freed of its stigma, so as to do least harm
to those who pursue it, and to benefit the whole state.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c010'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It need not be observed that this attitude of Plato toward trade
and commerce is alien to the spirit of economic progress, and that
no advanced civilization could be developed on such a basis. His
profuse legislation, too, as above outlined, strikes a modern as
naïve and visionary.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c010'><sup>[237]</sup></a> No man, however, is more aware of this
than Plato himself. He should be judged, not in a spirit of rigid
literalism, but with a sympathetic criticism which tries to understand
the psychological reasons for his attitude. His suggestions
are not offered as a proposed scheme for actual legislation,<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c010'><sup>[238]</sup></a> but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>rather in the spirit of the moralist, who, observing that almost
inevitable evils accompany retail trade and commercialism, with
human nature as it is, and that commerce, the servant of man, has
become his master, sees almost the only hope of escape in its limitation
to what is barely necessary. The age-long problem of a
greedy commercialism, which is blind to the appeal of all other
goods when profits are at stake, Plato certainly saw clearly, and
outlined with the hand of a master. The problem faces us still,
in a form even more acute, but the protests of Plato, Ruskin, and
Carlyle are bearing positive fruit today, in a political economy that
takes as its supreme goal human life at its best.</p>

<p class='c002'>But aside from these generalities, a sympathetic study of Plato’s
thought on exchange reveals an insight into certain specific points,
of interest to modern economics, which are commonly overlooked.
His protest against the former axiom of economics, that the prime
purpose of trade is profit, and that the mere fact that goods change
hands, necessarily increases the wealth of a country, is substantially
correct.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c010'><sup>[239]</sup></a> Commerce for commerce’ sake is a clear case of
mistaking the means for the end, and is contrary to sound economics
as well as ethics. The objections of Plato and Ruskin<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c010'><sup>[240]</sup></a>
against the principle too generally accepted by business and
economy of the past, at least tacitly, that “it is the buyer’s function
to cheapen and the seller’s to cheat,” are being recognized today
as worthy of consideration.</p>

<p class='c002'>The anxiety of Plato over the effect of trades or professions
upon character is well worthy of modern imitation, and this is, to
a considerable extent, an economic as well as a moral question.
Zimmern<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c010'><sup>[241]</sup></a> has well observed: “Our neglect to study the effect of
certain modern professions upon character, when we are always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>insisting, and rightly, upon the importance of a character-forming
education, is one of the strangest lapses, due to the sway of nineteenth-century
economics.”</p>

<p class='c002'>As we have seen, one of the chief purposes of Plato in his limitation
of commerce was to eliminate graft from the government.
Though his remedy was not acceptable, yet his remarkable appreciation
of a very grave problem that still faces us should be recognized.
Furthermore, no better solution for it has ever been offered
than the separation of politics from big business. This was the
underlying principle of his suggestion, and it is in accord with the
trend of modern statesmanship.</p>

<p class='c002'>Another impelling motive of Plato in his stringent legislation
was to render impossible the development of extremes of wealth
or poverty in the state. Again, we should credit him with having
clearly appreciated the problem, though we may criticize his
attempted solution. The great commercial prosperity of today
has made the situation vastly more acute, and still economics has
no satisfactory solution to offer. After all, in the light of modern
tendencies toward the regulation of industry and commerce, some
of Plato’s ideas do not seem so “grandfatherly,” but rather prophetic,
and in accord with sound economy. His legislation against
the sale of adulterated products,<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c010'><sup>[242]</sup></a> and in favor of publicity in business,<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c010'><sup>[243]</sup></a>
and state supervision of prices<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c010'><sup>[244]</sup></a> has a startlingly modern ring.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>POPULATION</h3>
<p class='c006'>The problem of population and food supply, which disturbed
Malthus and some of the other English economists, was also a cause
of concern to Greek thinkers. This might well be expected, since
it is a recognized fact that the source of the grain supply was always
a matter of grave concern to Athens and many other Greek cities.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c010'><sup>[245]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Plato states the problem clearly and hints at a solution, when he
says that the natural increase of population in his state shall not
exceed the economic basis for it.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c010'><sup>[246]</sup></a> In the <i>Laws</i>, he suggests specific
means for preserving the proper number by restraining over-productive
people, and by encouraging the opposite.<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c010'><sup>[247]</sup></a> If such
general provisions should not prove sufficient, he would then resort
to colonization.<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c010'><sup>[248]</sup></a> On the other hand, should population be greatly
depleted by war or disease, he would even open the doors of citizenship
to the undesirable classes.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c010'><sup>[249]</sup></a> His interest in the problem of
population, however, is primarily moral and social rather than
economic. Moreover, in antithesis to Malthus, he limits his
consideration to a very small, artificially constructed state. With
the narrow political vision of a Greek, he thinks that the production
of a <i>multitude</i> of “happy-hearted” men in a state is impossible.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c010'><sup>[250]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>DISTRIBUTION</h3>
<p class='c006'>As stated in the Introduction, the economic interest of Greek
thinkers was particularly alive in the fields of distribution and
consumption. It is here that they are especially interesting and
suggestive.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c010'><sup>[251]</sup></a> However, they dealt very little with the important
principles of distribution as laid down by modern economists.
Theories of the several elements that enter into distribution—wages,
profits, and rent—are for the most part conspicuously
absent.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c010'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The problem of distribution is also hardly considered from the
modern standpoint. We look in vain for a treatment of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>modern dominant question of the relation between capital and
labor. Moreover, the Greek theories of distribution are, on the
whole, not the outgrowth of the sentiment of human sympathy
for the poor and the common laborer, which is so prevalent today.
The purpose seems to be to guard against dishonesty rather than
oppression from either contracting party.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c010'><sup>[253]</sup></a> This lack in Greek
theory is not strange, in an age when slaves took the place of
machinery, so that capital and labor were largely united in them,
while the majority of free laborers worked directly for the public,
or on the land.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c010'><sup>[254]</sup></a> The goal of the theorists, therefore, is the conservation
of the state rather than the relief of any class of the
citizenship.</p>

<p class='c002'>Plato discusses the importance of a proper distribution of
wealth in the <i>Republic</i>, but the point that looms large to him is the
fact that excessive wealth or poverty is likely to endanger the
stability of the state.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c010'><sup>[255]</sup></a> As seen above, also, some of his regulations
in the <i>Laws</i> seem to strike a modern note. He would have a state
commission fix prices,<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c010'><sup>[256]</sup></a> would permit the state to limit the freedom
of inheritance,<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c010'><sup>[257]</sup></a> and perhaps even intervene in securing a just
wage.<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c010'><sup>[258]</sup></a> Yet in all of this, the dominant motive is to avoid civic
discord.</p>

<p class='c002'>Before proceeding to the larger subject in distribution, Plato’s
theory of private property, we will discuss briefly his attitude
toward the laboring classes.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c010'><sup>[259]</sup></a> It is commonly asserted that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Greek philosophers had little or no regard for the masses. As
usually expressed, however, the statement is very unfair, and
especially to Plato. Such extreme assertions as the following are
frequent: “They [the masses] are of no account altogether.”<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c010'><sup>[260]</sup></a>
Plato in the <i>Republic</i> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“voue à l’ignominie, au mépris, à la misère,
à la servitude éternelle la classe des ouvriers.”</span><a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c010'><sup>[261]</sup></a> <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Für die des
Erwerb obliegenden Personen bedarf es keiner Erziehung.”</span><a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c010'><sup>[262]</sup></a>
“Plato, in treating of the ideal state, deems it not worth while
to concern himself with the trading and artisan classes.”<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c010'><sup>[263]</sup></a> <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Und
im übrigen will er sie [the masses], wie es scheint, durchaus sich
selbst überlassen.”</span><a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c010'><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>To be sure, as above admitted, the interest of Greek thinkers
was not marked by the modern sentiment of sympathy for the
laborer. Their writings are characterized by a certain aristocratic
feeling, and they do not emphasize the worth or importance
of the masses. Yet they are far from being indifferent or hostile
to them.</p>

<p class='c002'>Aristotle himself was the first to make this false criticism of
Plato.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c010'><sup>[265]</sup></a> But the author of the <i>Republic</i> foresaw that he might be
misinterpreted, and excused himself for his indefiniteness in the
details of the ideal state.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c010'><sup>[266]</sup></a> Moreover, Aristotle’s criticism is not
borne out by a study of the <i>Republic</i>. Plato implies with sufficient
clearness that his communistic regulations are limited to the two
upper classes.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c010'><sup>[267]</sup></a> It is not true either, as Aristotle asserts,<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c010'><sup>[268]</sup></a> that
there is a rigid caste system in the <i>Republic</i>. The very opposite
principle is laid down.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c010'><sup>[269]</sup></a> The myth of the three metals presents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>an aristocracy based strictly on intellectual and moral excellence.
No arbitrary obstacle hinders either the degradation or the rise of
any individual from his class. It depends entirely upon the
possession of the gold of character and mentality, for which all
may strive. Moreover, the life of the so-called first caste is literally
dedicated to the best service of the rest. If this be aristocracy,
we cannot have too much of it.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c010'><sup>[270]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Neither is Aristotle’s criticism warranted, that Plato makes
the happiness of the whole state something different from the sum
of its parts.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c010'><sup>[271]</sup></a> He merely states the principle, universally true,
that no class has a right to expect to be happy at the expense of
the whole state, and that, in the long run, the prosperity of each
is bound up in the prosperity of all. Indeed, he puts the very
objections of Aristotle and Grote into the mouth of Adeimantus,
and answers them satisfactorily, in his illustration of the painted
statue.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c010'><sup>[272]</sup></a> There could hardly be a better example of Plato’s lofty
ideal, that each part is to contribute its share toward the utility,
beauty, and happiness of the whole, and that through this cooperation
each realizes the highest quantum of happiness for
himself. This doctrine of mutual interdependence is the basal
principle of Christianity, taught by Jesus and Paul in a strikingly
similar figure of the body and its members,<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c010'><sup>[273]</sup></a> though naturally
Plato’s idea of brotherhood is narrower in scope.</p>

<p class='c002'>The common assertion that Plato has no regard for the artisan
class, then, is unwarranted.<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c010'><sup>[274]</sup></a> The entire <i>Republic</i> is built upon the
opposite principle, to prevent exploitation of the lower by the
upper classes; and his comparison of good and evil rulers to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>shepherd dogs and wolves<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c010'><sup>[275]</sup></a> is a precursor of the famous passages of
Milton and Ruskin on the same theme. All classes of citizens in
the state are brothers.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c010'><sup>[276]</sup></a>  The rulers are saviors (σωτῆρας), allies,
shepherds (ποίμενες), nurses (τροφέας), paymasters, and friends.<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c010'><sup>[277]</sup></a>
This happy unity (ὁμόνοια), or harmony (ξυμφωνία), of all classes
is to Plato the highest goal toward which the true statesman should
strive,<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c010'><sup>[278]</sup></a> and the point of next highest importance to the communism
of the guards is the proper regulation of wealth and poverty for the
artisans.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c010'><sup>[279]</sup></a> The mere fact that he does not believe the artisans to
be capable of political independence by no means indicates that he
is indifferent to their social or economic welfare. It is to conserve
this that he would put the government into the hands of the most
capable,<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c010'><sup>[280]</sup></a> and, in any event, the artisans are not to be held in subjection
so much by external force as by their own free self-restraint.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c010'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
This, in itself, is sufficient evidence that Plato intended to include
the third class in his lower scheme of education, a fact borne out
also by other passages.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c010'><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It must be admitted that a somewhat different spirit pervades
the <i>Laws</i>, where he seems to have despaired of the lofty ideal of
the <i>Republic</i>. He relegates the working classes to non-citizenship.
But here, also, he is still anxious that they shall have the sort of
education that befits their station,<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c010'><sup>[283]</sup></a> and that justice be done them.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c010'><sup>[284]</sup></a>
He also provides against the existence of beggary in the state.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c010'><sup>[285]</sup></a>
Whatever may be said of his aristocratic spirit, therefore, he cannot
be justly accused of the gross indifference of the early nineteenth-century
economy and of modern capitalism toward either masses
or public, in their concern for material wealth.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c010'><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>COMMUNISTIC AND SOCIALISTIC IDEAS</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The Greek theory of distribution was employed chiefly in the
criticism of the institution of private property, and in the suggestion
of more or less communistic systems to succeed it. This
tendency, however, was not like the modern either in motive or in
general type. Modern socialism aims to be scientific, and professes
to build a scientific system on a basis of economic laws.
Greek socialism had no such aim. It did not lay claim to any
relation to economic law, but frankly presented itself for what it
was, a politico-moral sentiment. Other points of distinction will
be observed as we proceed, but this primary one must not be
overlooked, if either the spirit or the meaning of the Greek social
theory is to be understood.</p>

<p class='c002'>Two considerations made the communistic sentiment a normal
one to the Greek democrat. (<i>a</i>) The institution of private property
had not become so thoroughly imbedded in the very foundations
of society as it has today. The custom of family tenure was not
entirely forgotten, and in some backlying districts may well have
been still in vogue.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c010'><sup>[287]</sup></a> In some states, also, a part of the land was
probably still held in common by the citizenship. The frequent
establishment of cleruchies in conquered territories, in which the
land was regularly assigned by lot, and the ever-recurring revolutions,
which usually resulted in confiscation of the land in favor
of the victorious party, must have assisted materially in unsettling
the confidence of the Greeks in private property as a basal institution
of society. The actual existence of a polity like that of
Sparta, where private ownership does not seem to have been so
absolute,<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c010'><sup>[288]</sup></a> doubtless also exerted its influence on the imagination
of Greek thinkers. (<i>b</i>) As is generally recognized, the Greek, far
more than the modern, took for granted the subordination of the
individual citizen to the state. We have also seen that he tended
to magnify the power of legislation as sufficient to encompass any
reform, even in the face of economic laws. To him, therefore, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>demand that the state be made the dispenser of private property
did not seem unnatural.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c010'><sup>[289]</sup></a> We should be on our guard, however,
against exaggerating the extent of this sentiment among the
Greek writers, or against reading into them the modern socialistic
doctrines.</p>

<p class='c002'>A consideration of the predecessors of Plato in social speculation
may be conveniently introduced at this point, before we proceed
to the discussion of the <i>Republic</i>. Some have thought to find
traces of communism in Homer. The evidence of any real communism,
however, is very slight, and the frankly individualistic
spirit of the poems is against it. Moreover, this is a problem that
concerns the economic conditions rather than the theory.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c010'><sup>[290]</sup></a> Little
is definitely known of Pythagoras and his school, but it is improbable
that he either taught or practiced a real communism.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c010'><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>As for Hippodamas of Miletus, it is difficult to gain a clear idea
of his ideal state from Aristotle’s meager description,<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c010'><sup>[292]</sup></a> but it seems
not to have been markedly socialistic. He divides his body of ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>thousand citizens into artisans, farmers, and soldiers.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c010'><sup>[293]</sup></a> He makes
a corresponding triple division of the land—sacred, to provide for
the expense of worship; public, for the support of the soldiers;
private, to be owned and worked by the husbandmen.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c010'><sup>[294]</sup></a> Thus
only the farmers are to own land, and the question as to who shall
work the land for the military class is left in obscurity.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c010'><sup>[295]</sup></a> It seems
likely that Hippodamas intended that the farmers should work
all the land, and own one-third of it for their own support. His
system contains some communistic elements, as the fact that two-thirds
of the land is public, but it is certainly not socialistic
in spirit and purpose. The prime interest of Hippodamas was
very probably not in a system to supplant private property, but
rather in a plan of assured support for the priestly and military
classes.<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c010'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Phaleas of Chalcedon, according to Aristotle’s description,
approaches much nearer to the modern socialistic idea.<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c010'><sup>[297]</sup></a> Aristotle
makes him a type of those thinkers who lay chief stress on the
right system of property as the necessary basis of civic peace.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c010'><sup>[298]</sup></a>
His central tenet is equality of possessions and of education for all
the citizens,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c010'><sup>[299]</sup></a> but he seems to have specified only landed property.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c010'><sup>[300]</sup></a>
This demand, though only landed property is included, seems to
strike a truly modern socialistic note. But nowhere better than
here may we see the gulf that separates ancient and modern socialism.
The avowed interest of Phaleas is not in the masses. The
artisans are all to be public slaves.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c010'><sup>[301]</sup></a> His interest is rather in the
classes, and not even in these primarily, but rather in the state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>itself. His entire system has for its fundamental motive the
avoiding of civic discord in the state.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c010'><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The ideal state of Plato’s <i>Republic</i> has often been presented
by socialists and other modern writers as the great prototype of
all socialistic doctrine. We must consider to what extent such a
view is justified. In his famous myth of the three metals, Plato
divides his citizens into three classes—rulers, auxiliaries, and
farmers and artisans.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c010'><sup>[303]</sup></a> His avowed purpose here, as indeed
throughout his <i>Republic</i>, is to secure the highest degree of happiness
for all the citizens.<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c010'><sup>[304]</sup></a> In order to gain this end, he provides
for a most thoroughgoing system of communism, including all
property, both for production and for consumption, except such
as is necessary for the immediate need.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c010'><sup>[305]</sup></a> He extends it even to the
common possession of wives and children,<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c010'><sup>[306]</sup></a> that all private interests
may be reduced to a minimum.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c010'><sup>[307]</sup></a> He provides further for
a common work<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c010'><sup>[308]</sup></a> and education<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c010'><sup>[309]</sup></a> for men and women.</p>

<p class='c002'>Such, in brief, is the system proposed in the <i>Republic</i>.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c010'><sup>[310]</sup></a> Superficially
considered, it would seem to be the parent of modern
socialism and communism. There is, however, actually but slight
similarity between them. The so-called communism of Plato
extends only to the first two classes, which can include but a small
minority of the citizenship.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c010'><sup>[311]</sup></a> Thus the masses, with whom modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>socialism is especially concerned, are not directly touched by his
system. Again, the primary motive of Plato’s communism is not
the modern motive at all. His thought is not to secure a just share
for all in the products of industry. Though he recognizes the
importance of providing against the evils of extremes of wealth
and poverty,<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c010'><sup>[312]</sup></a> the motive is not the material interest of any class.
It is an intense desire for unity and for escape from civic strife in
the state,<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c010'><sup>[313]</sup></a> for provision against graft, corruption, and tyranny
in the rulers,<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c010'><sup>[314]</sup></a> and for insuring as efficient work as possible.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c010'><sup>[315]</sup></a> Like
Ruskin, Plato is no democrat. Equality is not in his thought.<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c010'><sup>[316]</sup></a>
Unlike many a modern socialist, he realizes that absolute arithmetical
equality is impossible, and that if gained it would be the
greatest injustice. He knows that the true equality must be
proportional, demanding not that each receive exactly the same,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>but that each receive his due.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c010'><sup>[317]</sup></a> His third class, comprising a large
majority of the citizens, is practically without political activity,
a fact in marked contrast to the modern social-democratic spirit.
His emphasis is not economic and material, as is that of modern
socialism, but political and moral.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c010'><sup>[318]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>In fine, the <i>Republic</i> contains some socialistic elements. Plato’s
restriction of the freedom of the individual so as to subserve the
interest of the whole,<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c010'><sup>[319]</sup></a> his tendency to magnify the power of law
in the face of economic principles and of human nature,<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c010'><sup>[320]</sup></a> his interest
in the welfare of the common people, his declaration against inequality
of fortune, his denial of the right of private property for the
upper classes, and his proposed community of wives and children,
a measure too radical for the better type of modern socialism,<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c010'><sup>[321]</sup></a>
all seem socialistic in trend.</p>

<p class='c002'>The tendency to magnify the power of law, and the submission
of individual to state interest, however, were characteristics of
Greek civilization, and not distinctly Platonic or socialistic. His
interest in the welfare of the masses, as we have seen, was not
primarily economic, but had for its ulterior motive the preservation
of the peace of the state. His denial of private property
and family interests to the guards, and his opposition to extreme
wealth or poverty were, as seen above, devoid of socialistic motive.
Moreover, in his hostility to retail trade, he was not moved by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the modern socialistic demand for immediate contact between
producer and consumer. The conditions that called forth such
a demand were not then in existence,<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c010'><sup>[322]</sup></a> as is also true of the modern
agitation for a proper distribution of the profits of industry.
Above all, Plato made no pretense to any economic basis for his
communism, but presented it as a moral and political ideal. The
<i>Republic</i> cannot therefore be classified as truly socialistic either in
motive or in general plan.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c010'><sup>[323]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>In any event, there is nothing in common between the high
moral idealism of Plato’s so-called communism and the crass
materialistic communism that is the subject of Aristophanes’
satire in the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i>. Dietzel<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c010'><sup>[324]</sup></a> has well pointed out that the
latter is extremely individualistic, atheistic, and immoral, demanding
all from the state with no return; that the <i>Republic</i>, on the
other hand, demands the loftiest morality and renunciation, and
is a direct protest against such tendencies in Athens as are attacked
by the comic poet. As he shows, the two are as far apart as are
the watchwords, “All for self,” and “All for all.”</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Plato’s idea that society is the exact counterpart of the individual
in the large, however, is quite analogous to the modern
comparison of society to an organism.<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c010'><sup>[325]</sup></a> Both are wrong in attempting
to press the analogy too far, yet they contain a truth of profound
importance, which is at the foundation of the marked change
in the spirit of economics in recent years. It is the notion of
solidarity, which demands that the individual shall no longer seek
the content of his being in himself alone, but also in the conditions
that shall produce the highest life for the commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the <i>Laws</i>, Plato reluctantly abandons some of the utopian
suggestions of the <i>Republic</i> for a more practical legislation,<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c010'><sup>[326]</sup></a> though
his ideal is really unchanged. Communism of property and of the
family are both discarded even for the rulers, as feasible only for
a supernatural order of beings.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c010'><sup>[327]</sup></a> As a noble ideal, however, it still
hovers before him.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c010'><sup>[328]</sup></a> Private property is permitted to the citizens,<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c010'><sup>[329]</sup></a>
but under protest, and if practicable, Plato would like to prohibit
it, as the primary root of all social disturbance and corruption.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c010'><sup>[330]</sup></a>
He would advocate, therefore, a return to the old régime of family
tenure, somewhat on the model of the Spartan system.<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c010'><sup>[331]</sup></a> He would
also hamper this by limitations so as to make it no real ownership
at all. The land is to be practically state property, over which the
citizens exercise merely the right of use.<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c010'><sup>[332]</sup></a> It is to be divided into
lots of equal value, corresponding exactly to the number of citizens.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c010'><sup>[333]</sup></a>
Natural disadvantages shall be compensated for by an increase in
the size of the lot, and part of each allotment shall be near, and
part at a distance from the city, that all may be on an equal footing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>and alike ready to defend against invasion.<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c010'><sup>[334]</sup></a> In order that no
citizen may lose his lot, and no man may possess more than one,
very stringent regulations are advised.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c010'><sup>[335]</sup></a> No lot may be purchased
or sold,<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c010'><sup>[336]</sup></a> confiscated,<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c010'><sup>[337]</sup></a> or divided by will to more than one heir,<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c010'><sup>[338]</sup></a>
and no citizen, in any manner whatsoever, may become owner of
more than one lot.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c010'><sup>[339]</sup></a> The living of the other members of the family
is arranged for by a provision for a general distribution of the
product of the soil, in imitation of the Cretan law.<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c010'><sup>[340]</sup></a> The annual
product of grain and cattle shall be divided into three equal parts,
one for citizens, one for their servants, and one for the artisans,
metics, and strangers. The first two parts shall not be subject
to sale, but each head of a family shall receive from them enough
to nourish his family and slaves.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is evident from all these regulations that Plato’s citizens
do not actually own their lots, but merely enjoy the usufruct of
them from the state on certain conditions. He takes away with
one hand what he gives with the other. Under such a system all
his precautionary measures could not have prevented the growth
of an even more oppressive poverty, unless the growth of population
could be checked.</p>

<p class='c002'>The regulations limiting the acquisition or possession of personal
property are even more stringent, though here an absolute
equality is not attempted. He seeks, however, to prevent the
rise of inequality of fortunes, at the very threshold, by making
undue acquisition difficult or even impossible for the citizens. All
money-making occupations are practically closed to them<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c010'><sup>[341]</sup></a>—trade,<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c010'><sup>[342]</sup></a>
the mechanical arts,<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c010'><sup>[343]</sup></a> and even agriculture, so far as their own personal
work is concerned. The latter is given over to slaves,<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c010'><sup>[344]</sup></a> the
arts and trade to aliens, with strict limitations to be enforced by
the officers of the market.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c010'><sup>[345]</sup></a> As seen above, two-thirds of the farm
products are not to be subject to commercial dealings.<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c010'><sup>[346]</sup></a> The
loan of money at interest is forbidden, and he who disobeys will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>risk the loss of both principal and interest.<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c010'><sup>[347]</sup></a> A bulky coinage of
baser metal is provided for the daily use of private citizens, such
as will not pass current in another country.<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c010'><sup>[348]</sup></a> No dowries are to be
given or received,<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c010'><sup>[349]</sup></a> and there shall be no hoarding, but the entire
produce of the lots must be annually distributed for consumption
among the whole population of the state.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c010'><sup>[350]</sup></a> To make assurance
doubly sure, Plato prohibits his citizens from owning personal
property above four times the value of the lot,<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c010'><sup>[351]</sup></a> or four minas.<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c010'><sup>[352]</sup></a>
Any amount in excess of this must be handed over to the state on
pain of severe fine for disobedience.<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c010'><sup>[353]</sup></a> This is to be accomplished
by the regulation that all property except the lot must be publicly
registered, and failure to fulfil this obligation entails the loss of
all but the original lot, and public disgrace.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c010'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>In all this drastic limitation of property rights, Plato’s chief
motive is to render excessive wealth or poverty impossible,<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c010'><sup>[355]</sup></a> and
to harmonize the citizenship by reducing all inequalities to a minimum.<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c010'><sup>[356]</sup></a>
This he purposes to accomplish, not merely by the foregoing
restrictions, but also by means of a common education,<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c010'><sup>[357]</sup></a>
and by the institution of the <i>sussitia</i>.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c010'><sup>[358]</sup></a> He makes the road to comparative
equality easier than in his first state by relegating all
the third class, the artisans, merchants, and farmers, outside the
pale of citizenship.<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c010'><sup>[359]</sup></a> The actual difference, however, is not so
great as it might appear. In the <i>Republic</i> there is equality in the
upper class, while in the <i>Laws</i> there is comparative equality among
the citizens who comprise only the upper class. In neither case
is there a real equality in the whole state. Plato is well aware
that only approximate equality can be attained, and that differences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>not only in property, but also in birth, virtue, strength, and beauty,
are bound to exist.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c010'><sup>[360]</sup></a> He would therefore have taxes and distributions
unequal in the same ratio, so as to avoid dissatisfaction
and dispute.<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c010'><sup>[361]</sup></a> The difficulties incident to such a scheme of legislation
he would obviate by starting a new state in virgin soil.<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c010'><sup>[362]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Souchon<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c010'><sup>[363]</sup></a> recognizes the Plato of the <i>Laws</i> as a true socialist,
and points to his attempt to prevent all inequality, and to his
extreme state intervention as characteristic elements of socialism.
Plato certainly does approach nearer to a real socialism in the
<i>Laws</i> than in the <i>Republic</i>. In addition to the points noted by
Souchon, there may be observed the application of the system of
equality to the whole citizenship, though at the cost of shutting
out all the workers; the strong sense of the social function of
property;<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c010'><sup>[364]</sup></a> the practical denial of real private ownership of land;
the demand for publicity in business, which is one of the chief
suggestions for the regulation of corporations today;<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c010'><sup>[365]</sup></a> the active
interest in the conservation of natural resources, which, while not
socialistic, lies in the direction of greater social control;<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c010'><sup>[366]</sup></a> and the
fact that distribution of the products of industry is made practically
a function of the state.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c010'><sup>[367]</sup></a> The demand for equality and unity is
also somewhat analogous to the modern socialistic hostility to
competition, which Ruskin calls the “law of death.”<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c010'><sup>[368]</sup></a> It may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>added further that Plato’s description of the economic strife in
his day is slightly suggestive of the criticism of capitalism by
modern socialism.<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c010'><sup>[369]</sup></a> However, the basal motive of Plato is, again,
not that of modern socialism. His aim is still primarily moral and
political rather than material,<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c010'><sup>[370]</sup></a> and he exhibits less interest in the
welfare of the laborers than he does in the <i>Republic</i>.<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c010'><sup>[371]</sup></a> Moreover,
his demand for equality is prompted by exactly the same motive
as was active in the <i>Republic</i>, not to ameliorate the condition of the
laborer, whom he has relegated to slavery, but to avoid the hated
civic discord (διάστασις) and to preserve the unity of the state.<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c010'><sup>[372]</sup></a>
The equality too, is in no sense analogous to that sought by modern
socialism, for, as seen above, it is merely equality within a class,
comprising the aristocratic minority of the state, and does not
touch the working masses at all.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c010'><sup>[373]</sup></a> In fine then, though there are
perhaps enough truly socialistic elements in the <i>Laws</i> to warrant
the classification of Souchon, yet if Plato’s ideal were realized, it
would be mainly a restoration of the old economic régime in Greece,
based on agriculture and the family tenure of property. Such an
ideal, modern socialists would doubtless fail to recognize as having
much in common with their own.<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c010'><sup>[374]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 id='chap4' class='c005' title='IV. Xenophon'>CHAPTER IV <br /> XENOPHON</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Xenophon was a man of affairs, whose interests touched the
practical life of the world on many sides, as is evidenced by the
broad scope of his extant works. He was also, however, a pupil
of Socrates. In his economic thought, therefore, he vacillates
between the positive interest of the practical economist and the
negative criticism of the Socratics.<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c010'><sup>[375]</sup></a> On the whole, his practical
bent dominates, and is especially exhibited in his essay on the
<i>Revenues of Athens</i>,<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c010'><sup>[376]</sup></a> as also in the fact that he was the first writer
to produce a work devoted entirely to economics.<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c010'><sup>[377]</sup></a> The spirit
of the moral philosopher, on the other hand, is prominent wherever
the influence of Socrates is felt, as in the first chapters of the
<i>Economicus</i> and in the <i>Memorabilia</i>. When the Socratic ideal
dominates, he, in common with other Greek thinkers, confuses
economics with ethics, and private with public economy.<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c010'><sup>[378]</sup></a> He
makes the science of economy deal with the management of private
estates,<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c010'><sup>[379]</sup></a> and believes with Plato and Ruskin that the same
qualities are necessary for the successful handling of the affairs
of either house or state.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c010'><sup>[380]</sup></a></p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>VALUE</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Xenophon insists strongly on utility or serviceableness as
a necessary quality of property (χρήματα,  κτήματα). By this,
however, he means primarily, not potential utility in the object,
but ability of the owner to use rightly.<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c010'><sup>[381]</sup></a> Even exchangeability
does not insure value in anything, unless the seller can use to
advantage that which he receives in return.<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c010'><sup>[382]</sup></a> This idea of value
is true enough from the ethical standpoint, and should not be left
out of account, as is being recognized by modern economists. But
to attempt to build a theory of economic value on such a basis,
as Ruskin does,<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c010'><sup>[383]</sup></a> would result in hopeless confusion. Value is not
merely an individual and moral, but also a social and economic,
fact.</p>

<p class='c002'>A hint of exchange value is given in the implied classification
of goods as usable or salable.<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c010'><sup>[384]</sup></a> But there is no discrimination
between useful things in the economic and uneconomic sense. In
the <i>Revenues</i>, on the other hand, when free from Socratic influence,
Xenophon makes a positive contribution to the theory of value.
He observes that the exchange value of goods varies with supply
and demand, and that this law is, in a sense, self-regulative by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>fact that workmen tend to enter other fields of activity whenever
any industry becomes unprofitable through an oversupply of its
products.<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c010'><sup>[385]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>WEALTH</h3>
<p class='c006'>The double standpoint of Xenophon is well illustrated in his
doctrine of wealth. On the one hand, he values it highly, and
tries to deduce practical rules for its increase and enjoyment.<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c010'><sup>[386]</sup></a>
On the other hand, like Socrates and Plato, he makes derogatory
comparisons between economic and spiritual wealth.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c010'><sup>[387]</sup></a> As in the
case of value, he offers no clear definition of economic wealth
(κτῆσις). It is defined indiscriminately as “whatever is useful
to life,” and “useful” is “everything that anyone knows how to
use.”<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c010'><sup>[388]</sup></a> But, as seen above, this is a purely subjective notion, and
is only one element in economic wealth.<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c010'><sup>[389]</sup></a> He also defines it (χρήματα)
as “the excess of goods over needs,” making it a merely
relative term:<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c010'><sup>[390]</sup></a> but here again the thought is ethical rather than
economic, an attempt to teach the somewhat ascetic principle that
a man’s riches are measured by the paucity of his wants.<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c010'><sup>[391]</sup></a> The
hostile or indifferent attitude to wealth is also assumed in the comparison
of it with so-called mental wealth and wisdom<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c010'><sup>[392]</sup></a> and in the
implication that it involves many cares.<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c010'><sup>[393]</sup></a> The idea so prominent in
Plato, however, that the acquisition or expenditure of great wealth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>is not consistent with justice, is not emphasized by Xenophon.
He calls that man happiest who has best succeeded in just acquisition,
and who uses his wealth in the best manner.<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c010'><sup>[394]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>PRODUCTION</h3>
<p class='c006'>The Greeks had no specific word for production, as we have,
since industry, though well developed, was not a dominant feature
of Greek life, and economics had not become a separate science.
The word ἐργασία, meaning “labor” or “business,” served the
purpose. The term was used of productive labor,<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c010'><sup>[395]</sup></a> of building or
manufacturing,<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c010'><sup>[396]</sup></a> of work in raw materials,<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c010'><sup>[397]</sup></a> most commonly of
agriculture,<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c010'><sup>[398]</sup></a> of industries in general,<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c010'><sup>[399]</sup></a> of the trades, commerce, or
other business for money-making,<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c010'><sup>[400]</sup></a> and of a guild of laborers.<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c010'><sup>[401]</sup></a>
The term ἡ ποιητικὴ τέχνη, “the productive art,” which approaches
more nearly to a specific, technical expression, was also used.<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c010'><sup>[402]</sup></a>
Thus, though there is no clear-cut term for production, the statement
of Zimmern<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c010'><sup>[403]</sup></a> that the Greeks had no better word for “business”
than ἀσχολία, “lack of leisure,” is hardly warranted.</p>

<p class='c002'>Xenophon was far more interested than Plato or Aristotle in
the problem of practical production. His shrewd discussion of
agriculture, and his urgent appeal to Athens to increase her revenues
by systematic exploitation of the mines, and by the encouragement
of industry and commerce, reveal a mind awake to economic
advantage. Though at times he seems almost to make war and
agriculture the only true means of production, it is evident that
he has a live interest in all means of acquisition.<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c010'><sup>[404]</sup></a> Toward the
theory of production, however, his contribution is not large. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the <i>Economics</i>, he recognizes the importance of labor and natural
resources in production, and in the <i>Revenues</i>, he sees the necessity
of capital.<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c010'><sup>[405]</sup></a> But naturally, like Aristotle and the southern planter,
he confuses capital with labor, in the person of the slave.<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c010'><sup>[406]</sup></a> The
fable of the dog and the sheep reveals a knowledge of the machinery
of production, and some insight into the proper relation between
the employer and the laborer.<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c010'><sup>[407]</sup></a> Xenophon’s distinct contribution
to future economic thought, however, consists in his appreciation
of the fact that economic production has its definite limits; that
the same ratio of profits cannot be increased indefinitely by the
constant addition of more labor and capital, but that these must
be proportioned to the greatest possible return.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c010'><sup>[408]</sup></a> To be sure, he
does not appreciate the scientific significance of the principle. His
purpose is rather to emphasize the danger of overproduction, and
he even fails to grasp the necessary application of this danger to
the silver mines. However, as the enunciator of the principle, he
may be called the forerunner of the doctrine of diminishing returns.</p>

<p class='c002'>As seen above, special emphasis was laid by Xenophon upon
natural resources as an element in production, both in land and in
the mines. His great interest in and eulogy of agriculture as the
basal industry, upon which all other sources of wealth depend,<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c010'><sup>[409]</sup></a>
have caused him to be classed with the physiocrats of modern time
but such an interpretation is hardly warranted. Without doubt,
agriculture is, in his opinion, the supremely honorable occupation.
It shares with war the right to be placed above all other vocations.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c010'><sup>[410]</sup></a>
It permits the maximum of leisure and physical development, and
is not unworthy of the personal attention of a prince.<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c010'><sup>[411]</sup></a> It is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>most pleasant, most productive,, most dignified, of callings;
the best exercise for the athlete, the finest school for education in
patriotism and justice, and it offers the greatest opportunity for
the exercise of hospitality to men and reverence to gods.<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c010'><sup>[412]</sup></a> Indeed,
it is the first of all occupations for an honorable and high-minded
man to choose.<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c010'><sup>[413]</sup></a> Here we have the highest eulogy of agriculture
in Greek literature. It is in essence a sound statement, and offers
a needed message for today.</p>

<p class='c002'>Though Xenophon recognized the practical importance of
capital in industrial enterprises,<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c010'><sup>[414]</sup></a> he developed no theory of it in
his writings. He appreciated, however, the value of being able
to keep a surplus.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c010'><sup>[415]</sup></a> The term ἀφορμή, as used by him of the provision
of raw material for weaving, probably signified nothing
more than it would have done to any Athenian business man of
his time.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c010'><sup>[416]</sup></a> The word originally meant a “starting-point,” especially
in war.<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c010'><sup>[417]</sup></a> Later, it signified the “means” or “resources”
with which one begins a project,<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c010'><sup>[418]</sup></a> especially in business. It was an
easy step from this general business use to the meaning, “financial
capital” of a banker.<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c010'><sup>[419]</sup></a> Other terms for capital were ἐνεργά, used
of interest-bearing capital in antithesis to ἀργά, of goods merely
for use;<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c010'><sup>[420]</sup></a> κάρπιμα, “goods that yield a produce,” as opposed to
ἀπολαυστικά, “goods to be enjoyed,”<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c010'><sup>[421]</sup></a> which is suggestive of Mill’s<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c010'><sup>[422]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>definition, “that part of his possessions ... which he designs
to employ in carrying on fresh production,” and of his two kinds
of capital, “circulating” and “fixed”; ποιητικά, “things for
further production,” as opposed to πρακτικά, “things merely for
use”;<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c010'><sup>[423]</sup></a> κεφάλαιος, of capital as opposed to interest or income.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c010'><sup>[424]</sup></a>
The term ἔρανος, also, since it came to mean a “contribution of
money,” was often used of a loan, and therefore approached the
signification of “money capital.”<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c010'><sup>[425]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Xenophon is considerably more favorable to labor and the
industrial life than are the other Socratics. He quotes Socrates
with apparent approval, that to do something well is well-being,
while he who does nothing well is neither good for anything nor
beloved of God.<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c010'><sup>[426]</sup></a> Work is far better than idleness. It produces
more happiness, makes the laborer more temperate and just, and
is the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sine qua non</i></span> for the independent life.<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c010'><sup>[427]</sup></a> This is a strong plea
for industry, and is especially significant, since it refers primarily,
to manufacture rather than to agriculture. The reference, however,
is to women workers, whose loss of leisure would not be an
injury to the state. Each person is encouraged to provide for
himself, and to do his work in the best possible manner,<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c010'><sup>[428]</sup></a> and the
maxim of Epicharmus, “For labor, the gods sell all goods to us,”
is heartily approved.<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c010'><sup>[429]</sup></a> All the foregoing passages are Hesiodic in
their insistence upon the value of industry.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c010'><sup>[430]</sup></a> But apart from his
evident acceptance of the doctrine of Socrates, as quoted above,
Xenophon exhibits a positive interest in labor. His attitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>toward the advancement of industry and commerce is thoroughly
modern, except that he does not contemplate the employment of
free citizen labor.<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c010'><sup>[431]</sup></a> He emphasizes labor almost as strongly as
natural resources as an important factor in production. He believes
also that industrial thrift and prosperity are the best means of
realizing a more quiet and orderly state.<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c010'><sup>[432]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Even the practical Xenophon, however, is not free from the
moral-aristocratic prejudice against mechanical arts (βαναυσικαί)
for the better class of citizens. He admits that they are justly
spoken against, and held in ill-repute, since they tend to weaken
the laborer both in body and in soul.<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c010'><sup>[433]</sup></a> The artisans have no leisure
to give either to their friends or to the state, and in a warlike state
the citizens cannot be thus employed.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c010'><sup>[434]</sup></a> The artisan is also servile
because of his ignorance of the higher moral sentiments (τὰ καλὰ
καὶ ἀγαθὰ καὶ δίκαια).<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c010'><sup>[435]</sup></a> All this sounds like Plato, but Xenophon
differs, in that he is in no wise opposed to the unlimited development
of industry and commerce, provided the drudgery of it may
be done by non-citizens.</p>

<p class='c002'>The principle of the division of labor is clearly stated by him,
but here again he differs from Plato in that his prime interest is
practical and economic rather than moral. He presents it as the
reason why royal dishes are superior in flavor to others, and makes
the acute observation that the division of labor is not so fully
applied in the small city, because there are not enough consumers
to support a man in one trade. In the large city, on the other
hand, the consumers are so numerous that even the trades themselves
are divided and subdivided. Thus much greater skill is
developed, and better results realized, for he who spends his time
in work of the narrowest compass (βραχυτάτῳ) must accomplish
this in the best manner.<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c010'><sup>[436]</sup></a> He does not specify the advantages of
the division of labor to industry, except that it results in greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>skill, but he reveals especial insight in stating so clearly the relation
of the market to the development of the principle.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c010'><sup>[437]</sup></a> In this,
he is the forerunner of Adam Smith, who observes that a minute
division of trades cannot exist except in the larger cities, especially
in coast and river towns.<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c010'><sup>[438]</sup></a> The assertion of Haney,<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c010'><sup>[439]</sup></a> that the
Greeks referred only to a “simple separation of employments,” is
certainly unwarranted in the light of this passage, for Xenophon
expressly distinguishes here the simple from the more complex
subdivision. He says that some are employed on men’s shoes,
others on women’s; some do the sewing (νευρορραφῶν), others do
the cutting (σχίζων), and that the same also is true in the manufacture
of clothing.<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c010'><sup>[440]</sup></a> This passage is also an evidence that the
development of industry in fourth-century Athens must have been
extensive. Xenophon also, like Plato, observed the fact that the
diversity in the natures of men is the basis for the division of
labor,<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c010'><sup>[441]</sup></a> though he did not follow him in his doctrine that men and
women should have the same work.<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c010'><sup>[442]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Unlike Plato, the idealist, Xenophon, the practical man of
affairs, takes the institution of slavery for granted, seemingly
unconscious of any ethical or economic problems involved.<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c010'><sup>[443]</sup></a> However,
as a matter of common-sense, he advises that slaves be
treated with consideration. He would give them a proper degree
of liberty,<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c010'><sup>[444]</sup></a> and arouse them to do their best<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c010'><sup>[445]</sup></a> by a fair system of
rewards and punishments. In the case of those slaves who hold
positions of trust, he advises that their affections should be won
by kindly treatment, and even by making them sharers in the
prosperity of the household.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c010'><sup>[446]</sup></a> Slavery is, of course, a condition
most irksome to the free-born. The unfortunate Eutheros would
almost prefer starvation.<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c010'><sup>[447]</sup></a></p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>MONEY</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In his treatise on the <i>Revenues of Athens</i>, Xenophon shows some
appreciation of the theory of money. He appears to take for
granted that money must have intrinsic value. At least, he understands
that silver is a commodity whose value is affected by its
use as such, as well as by its employment for currency.<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c010'><sup>[448]</sup></a> He also
apprehends the value of a silver currency for international commerce.<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c010'><sup>[449]</sup></a>
His naïvely enthusiastic argument for the indefinite
increase of the stock of silver, however, is suggestive of the mercantile
fallacy, which identified money with wealth.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c010'><sup>[450]</sup></a> But perhaps
he is merely using for practical purposes of argument the fact that
the Athenians were accustomed to look upon silver as the metal
for fixed and constant value.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c010'><sup>[451]</sup></a> In any event, he sees that the
increase of silver must be attended by a corresponding increase in
business activity, if its value is not to depreciate,<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c010'><sup>[452]</sup></a> and he cannot
be accused of the error of the mercantilists, that a country is impoverished
by the export of money.<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c010'><sup>[453]</sup></a> He must also have understood
clearly the importance of stability of value in a currency, since he
deems it necessary to show that the increased output of silver will
not decrease its value, and that silver is the least changeable of the
monetary metals.<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c010'><sup>[454]</sup></a> Despite his enthusiasm for his thesis, which
causes him to exaggerate the stability of silver, he does not fail
to grasp the direct effect of supply and demand upon it,<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c010'><sup>[455]</sup></a> just as
upon gold<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c010'><sup>[456]</sup></a> and other commodities.<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c010'><sup>[457]</sup></a> He shows also some understanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>of the quantitative theory of the relation between gold
and silver.<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c010'><sup>[458]</sup></a> It need hardly be added that, in strong contrast to
Plato, his attitude toward the precious metals, especially silver,
is very favorable.<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c010'><sup>[459]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>EXCHANGE</h3>
<p class='c006'>Xenophon presents no theory of exchange,<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c010'><sup>[460]</sup></a> though he is frankly
interested in the advance of commerce and trade. In his opinion,
the greater their development, the better it is for the city of Athens.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c010'><sup>[461]</sup></a>
He is full of practical suggestions to stimulate commercial activity.<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c010'><sup>[462]</sup></a>
So assured is he of the prime importance of extensive commerce to
a nation, that, in the spirit of modern commercialism, he insists
upon the necessity of peace for its sake.<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c010'><sup>[463]</sup></a> To his mind, increased
trade means not only material advantage, but social and political
as well, in that greater prosperity, more labor, and a better distribution
will mean greater satisfaction, and hence less danger of
revolution in the state.<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c010'><sup>[464]</sup></a> He entertains none of the prejudice of
the other Socratics against the money-makers’ art, a fact which
may well be a warning against the too ready acceptance of their
attitude as the usual verdict of the Athenian citizens.<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c010'><sup>[465]</sup></a> In his
practical suggestions for the development of commerce there is
a hint of the protective principle. He advises that certain advantages
be granted to shipowners so as to induce them to increase their
shipping.<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c010'><sup>[466]</sup></a> But the purpose is not to limit the advantage to
Athenian merchantmen, nor to restrict import trade. It is rather
the opposite. He would enrich the city by tribute on both imports
and exports, imposed for sumptuary and revenue purposes,<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c010'><sup>[467]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>would also develop a public merchant-marine for rent to merchants,
as a further source of income.<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c010'><sup>[468]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>POPULATION</h3>
<p class='c006'>In antithesis to Plato and Aristotle, the problem of population
has no difficulties for Xenophon. He does not deem it advisable
to set a limit on the population of the state. On the contrary, he
conceives it as one of the advantages of his plan in the <i>Revenues</i>,
that thereby the city would become very populous, and thus land
about the mines would soon be as valuable as that in the city
itself.<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c010'><sup>[469]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>DISTRIBUTION</h3>
<p class='c006'>Xenophon is far less concerned about the problem of distribution
than Plato. He has no suggestions as to wages, profits, or
prices, no ideal state where an equitable distribution shall be realized,
no yearnings after equality, or complaints against the evils of
extreme wealth or poverty. Like Plato, he would avoid civic
discord in the state,<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c010'><sup>[470]</sup></a> but by the increase of production and exchange
rather than by their limitation. In Socrates’ parable of the dog
and the sheep, he presents a suggestion of a theory of profits, but
his plea is for the employer instead of the laborer. The right of
the former to share in the profits of the business is based on his
service as overseer of the work, and as protector of the workmen.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c010'><sup>[471]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Our author does not definitely reveal his attitude toward the
poorer masses, but it seems probable that he had little interest
in them, except in so far as their condition might affect the fortunes
of the state. He was, of course, opposed to giving them full
political rights,<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c010'><sup>[472]</sup></a> and would probably have preferred a system such
as that in Plato’s <i>Laws</i>, where all free citizens have sufficient
income so that they can give their time largely to the state, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>where all laborers are slaves. He did not think of suggesting that
the poorer citizens work in the mines, or even that aliens do so,
but suggested rather that each citizen have the income from three
state slaves.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c010'><sup>[473]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>While Xenophon is not usually considered among the socialists
of Greece, he approaches perhaps even nearer than Plato to one
phase of modern socialism. Like Plato, he opposes the extreme
individualism of the political and private life of his day.<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c010'><sup>[474]</sup></a> He also
reveals the Greek feeling of the social obligation of private property.<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c010'><sup>[475]</sup></a>
Again, as do Plato and modern socialists, he magnifies the power
of law to transform economic or social conditions.<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c010'><sup>[476]</sup></a> But in advocating
the modern doctrine of the socialization of industry, with
an economic, and not a moral or political, motive, he has advanced
beyond either Plato or Aristotle, and approaches modern socialism.<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c010'><sup>[477]</sup></a>
As seen above, however, his economic motive is not interest in the
welfare of the masses, for by his scheme they would all be slaves.
He desires only to abolish poverty among the citizens.<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c010'><sup>[478]</sup></a> He would
have the state become entrepreneur, not merely in one, but in
many branches of industry. State merchant shipping,<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c010'><sup>[479]</sup></a> public
ownership of slaves,<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c010'><sup>[480]</sup></a> public exploitation of the mines,<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c010'><sup>[481]</sup></a> public
buildings near the mines, for rental to strangers,<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c010'><sup>[482]</sup></a> are all in his plan.
The rich must finance the scheme, but their profit will be 18, 36,
or even 200 per cent.<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c010'><sup>[483]</sup></a> Companies are to be organized so as to
obviate individual risk.<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c010'><sup>[484]</sup></a> Thus will poverty be no more, plenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>for all will reign, and there will be an era of prosperity and security
for the state.<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c010'><sup>[485]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>His thesis is, in a word, that what private capital can accomplish
for the enrichment of itself alone, state capital can accomplish to
better advantage for the enrichment of the whole citizenship,<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c010'><sup>[486]</sup></a>
a doctrine which strikes a truly modern socialistic note.</p>

  <h2 id='chap5' class='c005' title='V. The Orators: Demosthenes, Isocrates'>CHAPTER V <br /> THE ORATORS—DEMOSTHENES, ISOCRATES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Though the Attic orators constitute a very important source
for our knowledge of economic conditions in Athens, they furnish
but little definite material for a history of Greek economic thought.
From the standpoint of theory, their chief value consists in the
fact that they all reveal a positive interest in wealth and all the
phenomena of practical economy. In this respect, they present
a striking contrast to the negative attitude of the Socratics, and
thus serve to correct our conception of the economic ideas of the
average Athenian citizen. Specific consideration need be given
only to Demosthenes and Isocrates.</p>

<p class='c002'>The positive interest of Demosthenes in commerce and finance
has already been indicated by some passages,<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c010'><sup>[487]</sup></a> and this fact is so
evident throughout all his orations that further citations are
unnecessary. Instead, we may note briefly some slight hints in
him of the negative moral attitude of the philosophers. He
emphasizes the dominating influence of money in warping the
judgments of men.<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c010'><sup>[488]</sup></a> He praises the simple life of the previous
generation, and criticizes in contrast the private luxury of his own
day.<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c010'><sup>[489]</sup></a> According to him, it is considered to be rare for a business
man to be both diligent (φιλεργόν) and honest (χρηστόν).<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c010'><sup>[490]</sup></a> In his
assertion that poverty compels freemen to turn to menial work
(δουλικά) and that many freewomen (ἀσταί) have been driven by
the stress of the times to such vocations,<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c010'><sup>[491]</sup></a> some aristocratic prejudice
against common labor seems to be implied. A similar attitude
toward traders and money-dealers is at least suggested by his
question as to what is the worst (πονηρότατον) element in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>state.<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c010'><sup>[492]</sup></a> His scornful mention of Stephanus as one who loans money
at interest, and takes advantage of another’s need,<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c010'><sup>[493]</sup></a> is a slight
reminder of the philosophic prejudice against interest, though here he
is doubtless emphasizing loans for consumption merely, at an exorbitant
rate.<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c010'><sup>[494]</sup></a> But these traces of the Socratic attitude toward wealth
are of very little significance, in the face of the evident economic
interest that characterizes all the orations of Demosthenes.</p>

<p class='c002'>Isocrates may, in a sense, be reckoned among the Socratics,
and he exhibits more of their spirit in relation to wealth than do
any of the other orators. He would have men strive for honest
character rather than for wealth, since it is not always gain to
acquire and loss to spend. The result depends rather upon the
occasion and virtue.<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c010'><sup>[495]</sup></a> Noble character is of more value than great
riches,<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c010'><sup>[496]</sup></a> for good reputation is not purchasable (ὠνητή) with money,
but is itself the source of material possessions, and it is immortal,
while wealth is only temporal.<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c010'><sup>[497]</sup></a> Material and spiritual wealth are
thus contrasted in true Socratic manner;<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c010'><sup>[498]</sup></a> right use is emphasized,<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c010'><sup>[499]</sup></a>
and the common insatiety and injustice of money-makers is
opposed.<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c010'><sup>[500]</sup></a> Folly and license are named as the usual accompaniments
of wealth, in contrast to the moderation that characterizes
the poor and lowly.<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c010'><sup>[501]</sup></a> But, like Plato, Isocrates considers neither
luxury nor penury to be the ideal condition,<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c010'><sup>[502]</sup></a> and clearly appreciates
the evil effect of poverty in arousing discontent and civic
strife in the state.<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c010'><sup>[503]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>But despite this moralizing tendency, he agrees with the other
orators in appreciating highly the economic importance of the
manual arts.<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c010'><sup>[504]</sup></a> He points also, with apparent pride, to the extensive
commerce of Athens as compared with that of other states,<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c010'><sup>[505]</sup></a>
and one of his chief arguments for peace is that thereby the city
will be filled with merchants and strangers and metics.<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c010'><sup>[506]</sup></a> This
entire plea for peace, which he bases so largely on economic advantage,
has a decidedly modern ring. He understood well the importance
of industrial development in the general prosperity of a
democracy. In almost Aristotelian language, he pictures how in
the good old days the rich were accustomed to give the poor a start
in business (ἀφορμή), either in agriculture, trade, or the arts.<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c010'><sup>[507]</sup></a>
This positive economic interest is further evidenced by his emphasis
upon the increased skill that results from the application of the
division of labor.<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c010'><sup>[508]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Isocrates, like Plato, was especially opposed to civic strife
and the extreme individualistic communism that demanded a
redivision of lands and abolition of debts.<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c010'><sup>[509]</sup></a> In the ideal past of
his dreams, there were no extremes of wealth and poverty, private
property was safe, and revolutions did not rend the state. Now,
on the other hand, all is changed. Sparta is the only state that
has not been torn by the bitter party strife.<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c010'><sup>[510]</sup></a> He contrasts the
high regard in which the wealthy were held in his boyhood with the
present jealous discontent. To be known as a wealthy man now is
almost equivalent to being considered criminal and is a thing for
which to apologize.<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c010'><sup>[511]</sup></a> This attitude toward the rich, of which
Isocrates complains, is significant in the light of similar tendencies
in our own democracy today.</p>

<p class='c002'>Again, in agreement with Plato and Aristotle, Isocrates opposes
the doctrine of mere arithmetical equality, and insists that the true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>equality apportions to each what befits his capacity.<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c010'><sup>[512]</sup></a> But though
he is hostile to the crasser type of communism, he makes the chief
characteristic of the ideal past a noble community feeling and spirit
of co-operation. In that happy time, the common weal was first
in the thought of all, each had regard for others’ interests, the
poor were not jealous of the rich, and the rich assisted the poor.<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c010'><sup>[513]</sup></a>
At times, he even approaches the modern humanitarian sentiment
for the submerged classes. He defines true national prosperity
as a condition in which no citizen is lacking the means of livelihood,<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c010'><sup>[514]</sup></a>
and thinks the poor might well be pardoned for their indifference
to public welfare, in their anxiety over the daily means of subsistence.<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c010'><sup>[515]</sup></a>
He also states the somewhat socialistic principle so
emphasized by Plato, that the character of the state will be like
that of the ruler.<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c010'><sup>[516]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 id='chap6' class='c005' title='VI. Aristotle'>CHAPTER VI <br /> ARISTOTLE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In the writings of Aristotle, we find a much richer source for
a history of Greek economic thought. Though no extant work of
his is devoted to economics, he left a multitude of writings on
diverse subjects, as a monument to his wonderful versatility and
tireless industry.<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c010'><sup>[517]</sup></a> Of these, the <i>Politics</i> and the <i>Ethics</i> are especially
fruitful in economic ideas, though, as in the case of Plato,
such material is incidental to the main discussion. His general
attitude toward wealth and some of its problems, we shall find to
be often substantially in agreement with that of Plato. His
economic vision was prejudiced by the same ethico-aristocratic
spirit. Yet his practical, scientific mind caused him to deal with
many economic questions more extensively, more directly, and more
incisively than is true of any other Greek thinker. Caution must
be observed, however, against reading into his statements more
meaning than he purposed to convey. He was not the creator of
the science of political economy,<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c010'><sup>[518]</sup></a> though his apprehension of many
of the chief concepts of economics was probably clearer than has
often been admitted by modern economists.<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c010'><sup>[519]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>At the very threshold of economic speculation, Aristotle
advanced beyond Plato and Xenophon, in that he perceived the
fallacy in the confusion of household and public economy. He saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>that they differed, not only in size or numbers, but in essential
type.<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c010'><sup>[520]</sup></a> In his later discussion of wealth, however, he overlooked
his distinction, and fell into the old Greek confusion.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>VALUE</h3>
<p class='c006'>The extent of Aristotle’s contribution to the theory of value has
been very diversely estimated.<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c010'><sup>[521]</sup></a> In a classic passage of the <i>Politics</i>,
he distinguishes between the two uses of an object, the direct use
for which it was produced, and the indirect as an article for
exchange.<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c010'><sup>[522]</sup></a> This has often been heralded as an anticipation of
Adam Smith’s distinctions between value in use and value in
exchange.<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c010'><sup>[523]</sup></a> Such an interpretation, however, is hardly warranted.<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c010'><sup>[524]</sup></a>
The entire emphasis of Aristotle in the passage is upon use rather
than upon value. The exchange use is declared subordinate, and
the context shows that the purport of the statement is to teach the
uneconomic doctrine that exchange (μεταβλητική) is an artificial
use, especially when pursued for gain.</p>

<p class='c002'>Moreover, the passage fails to develop the definition further
by distinguishing between economic utilities that involve a cost
of production, and other necessities that are devoid of exchange
value because of their universality.<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c010'><sup>[525]</sup></a> Need is recognized as an
element in exchange value,<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c010'><sup>[526]</sup></a> but it is not differentiated from economic
demand that has the means to purchase. All that can safely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>be said of this statement of Aristotle, therefore, is that he accidentally
hit upon a basal distinction, which, had it been his purpose,
he might have used as starting-point for the development of the
modern theory of value.</p>

<p class='c002'>Certain other passages from his writings reveal a clearer apprehension
of the distinction. In the <i>Rhetoric</i>, he states the principle
that exchange value is measured by rarity, though this may not
be a criterion of the actual value of the commodity to life.<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c010'><sup>[527]</sup></a> The
latter is measured by its necessity or practical utility.<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c010'><sup>[528]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>A paragraph from the <i>Nicomachaean Ethics</i>, though it does not
treat the problem directly, is also an evidence of Aristotle’s insight
into the elements of economic value.<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c010'><sup>[529]</sup></a> It has been strangely
slighted by most historians of economic thought, though its significance
has been recognized by editors of the <i>Ethics</i>.<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c010'><sup>[530]</sup></a> It grows
out of his discussion of fair exchange, which is a part of the larger
subject of justice. He observes that a proportional equality
(κατὰ τὴν ἀναλογίαν ἴσον) between diverse products must exist
before exchange can take place,<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c010'><sup>[531]</sup></a> since the labor involved in their
production is not equal.<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c010'><sup>[532]</sup></a> This equality he obtains through a proportion,
in which the objects of exchange stand in inverse ratio
to the producers.<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c010'><sup>[533]</sup></a> The equalization of the commodities is thus
based, according to Aristotle, upon an estimate of the labor or
cost of production in each case.<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c010'><sup>[534]</sup></a> Again, he points out that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>standard by which all products are measured is need or demand
(χρεία) for reciprocal services,<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c010'><sup>[535]</sup></a> thereby making demand a social
fact dependent upon organized society. It is, in his thought, the
“common denominator of value” which finally determines the
actual basis on which all goods are exchanged or services rendered.
Elsewhere Aristotle’s conception of value is more individualistic,
like that of Xenophon and Plato, but Haney<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c010'><sup>[536]</sup></a> overlooks this passage
in asserting that his notion of value is “purely subjective.” It is
not merely “equal wants” that are considered, as he states, but
equal costs as well.<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c010'><sup>[537]</sup></a> This demand, or common measure of value,
is expressed in terms of money (νόμισμα).<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c010'><sup>[538]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It is clear then, from this passage in the <i>Ethics</i>, that Aristotle
understood that economic value is determined by demand, as measured
in money, and by labor invested or cost of production.<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c010'><sup>[539]</sup></a> This
latter element, of course, involves the condition that the product be
limited in supply, though this is not expressly stated.<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c010'><sup>[540]</sup></a> To be sure,
the interest of the moral philosopher is also paramount here,<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c010'><sup>[541]</sup></a> as in
the <i>Politics</i> passage. The thought is centered on fair exchange, as a
phase of justice, rather than upon the problem of value. Nevertheless,
his discussion reveals a clear insight into demand and cost of
production as the two most important elements in economic value.<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c010'><sup>[542]</sup></a></p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>WEALTH</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Since Aristotle had a better apprehension of the theory of value
than other Greek thinkers, we may expect him also to define more
clearly the concept of wealth. In the <i>Politics</i>, he names the
following attributes of genuine (ἀληθινός) wealth (πλοῦτος): necessary
to life; useful to persons associated in a household or a state;
capable of accumulation (θησαυρισμός); limited in extent (οὐκ
ἄπειρος).<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c010'><sup>[543]</sup></a> According to Mill,<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c010'><sup>[544]</sup></a> from the “economic” standpoint,
wealth is “all useful and agreeable things” of a “material nature”
possessing “exchange value”; and, to have exchange value, they
must be “capable of accumulation.”</p>

<p class='c002'>In comparing these two definitions, it should be recognized at
the outset that Aristotle’s term “genuine” does not mean “truly
economic,” as it might in Mill, but rather “legitimate wealth” as
distinguished from that gained from false finance (χρηματιστική);<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c010'><sup>[545]</sup></a>
also that his “necessary to life” and “limited in extent” are not
used in the economic but in the moral sense, as opposed to luxury
and extreme interest in money-making. Mill’s “all useful and
agreeable things” presents a marked contrast to this in spirit.
Aristotle’s “useful” means “what subserves the final good” (πρὸς
ἀγαθὴν ζωήν), while Mill’s means “things that give sensations of
comfort or pleasure.” Thus Aristotle’s wealth is necessarily
limited, while Mill’s is unlimited, since, as Barker observes, “only
an infinity of wealth can satisfy an infinity of need.”<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c010'><sup>[546]</sup></a> It will be
seen from the following discussion, however, that Aristotle includes
more than “necessary things” in his category of economic wealth.
He does not specify “material things,” as does Mill, but it seems
probable that this is his meaning.<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c010'><sup>[547]</sup></a> In all the passages where he
enumerates the different kinds of wealth, only material things are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>included, except slaves, who are counted as mere tools.<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c010'><sup>[548]</sup></a> One of
these passages specifically excludes intellectual wealth by defining
property as a “separable instrument.”<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c010'><sup>[549]</sup></a> The use of the term for
value (ἀξία) probably implies the same limitation.<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c010'><sup>[550]</sup></a> Though
Aristotle does not mention exchange value specifically, it is clearly
implied in his definition. “Things useful for the association of a
state” and things “capable of accumulation” must have exchange
value, thus excluding illimitable utilities such as air and light.<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c010'><sup>[551]</sup></a>
His use of κτῆμα, “possession,” and his recognition of cost of production
and economic demand as the main factors in determining
value,<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c010'><sup>[552]</sup></a> are further evidence of this. Moreover, as seen above,
in the <i>Ethics</i>, he clearly makes exchange value an attribute of all
wealth.<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c010'><sup>[553]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>From our comparison of the two definitions, then, it is evident
that, though Aristotle is antithetical to Mill in putting the ethical
interest first, and though his definition is not so scientifically
specific, yet the two agree in recognizing the qualities of materiality,
exchange value, and possibility of accumulation as necessary
attributes of wealth. We shall see below, also, that the Greek
philosopher was the forerunner of the orthodox English economists
in criticizing the common confusion of money with wealth.<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c010'><sup>[554]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>But, despite his grasp of the leading principles in the economics
of wealth, he takes the same negative moral attitude toward wealth
as does Plato, though his hostility is also directed primarily against
the spirit that commercializes life and makes unlimited wealth the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>summum bonum</i></span>. To his mind, this idea that wealth is the sum of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>all goods is almost the necessary accompaniment of the possession
of superfluous wealth, but it is especially characteristic of the new-rich
(νεωστὶ κεκτημένοις).<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c010'><sup>[555]</sup></a> Yet Aristotle is too practical to be
ascetic. He realizes that leisure (σχολή) is necessary for moral
development and for good citizenship, and that this cannot be
enjoyed except on a basis of sufficient wealth. A fair competency
is therefore desirable for the best life,<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c010'><sup>[556]</sup></a> for men should live not only
temperately, but liberally.<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c010'><sup>[557]</sup></a> Poverty produces civic strife and
crime.<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c010'><sup>[558]</sup></a> Wealth in the absolute sense (ἁπλῶς) is always good,
though it may not always be fitted to a certain individual, or be
property used by him.<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c010'><sup>[559]</sup></a> Each, therefore, should choose what is
good for himself, and use it accordingly.<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c010'><sup>[560]</sup></a> All this sounds saner
than the subjective notion of wealth taught by Plato. But right
here is the secret of the difficulty as Aristotle sees it. Just because
all external wealth is good in the absolute sense, the popular error
has arisen that it is the final cause (αἰτία) of all happiness,<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c010'><sup>[561]</sup></a> whereas
the actual relation of wealth to happiness is the same as that of the
lyre to the tune. There can be no music without the intervention
of the musician.<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c010'><sup>[562]</sup></a> External goods are therefore not of primary
importance to life. The goods of the soul should be placed first,<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c010'><sup>[563]</sup></a>
for the virtues of life are not gained and preserved by material
wealth, but vice versa,<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c010'><sup>[564]</sup></a> and the men of high character and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>intelligence are most happy, even though their wealth is moderate.<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c010'><sup>[565]</sup></a>
The common attitude of the money-maker that wealth is unlimited
is contrary to nature.<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c010'><sup>[566]</sup></a>  Genuine wealth cannot be unlimited,<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c010'><sup>[567]</sup></a> since
external goods are strictly defined by their utility for a certain
thing. Excessive wealth thus either harms the owner, or is, at
least, useless to him.<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c010'><sup>[568]</sup></a>  Neither can wealth be rightly made the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>summum bonum</i></span>, for it is really not an end at all, but only a collection
of means to an end (ὀργάνων πλῆθος).<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c010'><sup>[569]</sup></a> The inevitable result
of making it the end and measure of all is moral degeneration.<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c010'><sup>[570]</sup></a> If
the highest interests of life are to be preserved, it must always be
kept subservient. First things must be placed first, both by the
individual<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c010'><sup>[571]</sup></a> and by the state.<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c010'><sup>[572]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>PRODUCTION</h3>
<p class='c006'>It is often asserted that Aristotle denied the very existence of
a problem of production.<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c010'><sup>[573]</sup></a> This statement has been based primarily
on certain passages in the <i>Politics</i>.<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c010'><sup>[574]</sup></a> These passages, however,
are not a denial of the importance of production. Their
purport is merely to show that the chief aim of life is not to produce
or to provide wealth, but to use it for the advancement of life’s
highest interest. From this standpoint, both acquisition (κτητική)
and production (ποιητική) are subordinate arts.<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c010'><sup>[575]</sup></a> So far is Aristotle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>from giving no place to production, that a later chapter
of the <i>Politics</i> is devoted to the consideration of the scheme of
supply, including production.<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c010'><sup>[576]</sup></a> To be sure, he does not lay much
emphasis on genuine production in his enumeration. Industry is
barely mentioned, while agriculture is discussed in detail. His
“free-holder” is a consumer of the gifts of nature, rather than a real
producer.<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c010'><sup>[577]</sup></a> He classifies the truly productive employments that
work for themselves (αὐτόφυτον) as those of the nomad, the farmer,
the brigand, the fisherman, and the hunter, and makes those that
live by barter (ἁλλαγῆς) or trade (καπηλείας) parasitic.<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c010'><sup>[578]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>In another passage, finance, strictly defined (οἰκειατάτη), is
limited to all forms of agriculture, and even the hired labor (μισθαρνία)
of industry is included in unnatural finance.<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c010'><sup>[579]</sup></a> Aristotle
has thus often been compared to the physiocrats, who distinguished
between creative and parasitic classes of workers, upheld the
“natural” order as the ideal, and eulogized agriculture and the
“extractive” industries as the only productive ones. As Souchon<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c010'><sup>[580]</sup></a>
has observed, however, the resemblance is only superficial. Yet
the fact that he fails to see that exchange is productive of a time
and place value, and the fact that he includes hired labor, skilled
and unskilled, among the unnatural activities, are sufficient evidence
that he had only a superficial grasp of the principles of production.<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c010'><sup>[581]</sup></a>
But the frequent assertion that he includes brigandage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and war among the productive arts is unwarranted, for he classifies
them only among the acquisitive means.<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c010'><sup>[582]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Aristotle almost outdoes Plato in his subordination of all production
to ethics, though he keeps their respective aims more
distinct. According to him, the productive arts are not ends in
themselves. They are means to the supreme end of the moral
life, whose first interest is not in production, but in right action.<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c010'><sup>[583]</sup></a>
As seen in our discussion of Plato, such a doctrine is not fruitful,
economically. If interpreted too rigidly, it stifles commerce and
industry. Yet, at bottom, it holds a great truth which modern
economists are emphasizing—the fact that wealth and production
alike must be subordinated to the general individual and social
good. Moreover, the philosopher should not be interpreted in too
hard-and-fast a manner. Barker is extreme in his statement that
the economic theory of Aristotle is a mere treatise on “the ethics
of family life” and that “the fundamental characteristic of his idea
of production is a reactionary archaism, which abolishes all the
machinery of civilization in favor of the self-supporting farm and
a modicum of barter.”<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c010'><sup>[584]</sup></a> Bonar’s assertion is also unwarranted,
that “Aristotle thinks it beneath the dignity” of his discourse to
give the practical details of agriculture and industry “more than
a cursory notice.”<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c010'><sup>[585]</sup></a> Such details were not germane to the plan of
his work, and would certainly be considered out of place in a modern
general text on economics. Aristotle’s economic doctrine, as a
whole, is certainly far broader in scope than the family, and, while
based upon ethics, is something more than an ethical treatise. As
seen above, he recognizes the necessity of a moderate acquisition
of wealth, both for the prosperous state and for the virtuous man,
and demands only that the human interest be put first.<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c010'><sup>[586]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span><i>Agriculture.</i>—Of the factors that enter into production, Aristotle
is, like the other Socratics, most interested in natural resources.
He emphasizes especially the agricultural life. To his mind, it is
the only true foundation of “natural finance,” since the financial
means should be provided in nature herself.<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c010'><sup>[587]</sup></a> Natural finance
(οἰκειατάτη) is made to include only a proper knowledge of the care
of land, cattle, bees, fowl, and other natural resources.<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c010'><sup>[588]</sup></a> It is
natural, since it does not earn at the expense of others, as do retail
trade and other methods of false finance. Aristotle also reveals
his interest in agriculture by giving a bibliography of the subject.
He names Charetides of Paros, Apollodorus of Lemnos, “and
others on other branches”—a hint that many such works on practical
economics may be lost to us.<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c010'><sup>[589]</sup></a> However, his interest, even in
this primary industry, is not of a practical nature, like that of
Xenophon. He relegates it to the non-citizen classes, along with
commerce and the mechanical arts.<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c010'><sup>[590]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><i>Capital.</i>—Aristotle is the only Greek thinker who has given
a clear definition of capital. After defining the slave as an instrument
(ὅργανον), in order to distinguish still more sharply, he differentiates
between the two kinds of wealth—that which is used for
consumption, and that which is employed for further production.<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c010'><sup>[591]</sup></a>
As an example of the former, he uses the bed and the dress, and of
the latter the weaver’s comb (κερκίς).<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c010'><sup>[592]</sup></a> He points out that all
wealth is produced for consumption, but that part of it is consumed
indirectly in manufacture. Here is an approach to Adam Smith’s<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c010'><sup>[593]</sup></a>
definition of capital, as “that part of a man’s stock which he expects
to afford him revenue.” Unfortunately, however, the Greek fails
to pursue his distinction farther. The theme of his thought is,
after all, not capital or production either, but the status of the slave,
though, from his standpoint, the slave is capital. He proceeds
with the very uneconomic assertion that life consists in action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>(πρᾶξις), not in production (ποίησις),<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c010'><sup>[594]</sup></a> and concludes with the real
goal of his argument, that the slave is an assistant (ὑπερέτης), or
an animate instrument in the realm of action, not of production.<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c010'><sup>[595]</sup></a>
The slave is therefore an instrument to increase the life or action
of his master, who himself is not represented as a producer, but as
a consumer of the present stock. Thus what bids fair to be a fruitful
distinction ends in a denial of the primary importance of production.
The purpose of Aristotle is here similar to that in some
passages of Ruskin<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c010'><sup>[596]</sup></a> and Adam Smith,<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c010'><sup>[597]</sup></a> to emphasize consumption
rather than production.</p>

<p class='c002'>In another passage, he repeats his definition of capital in different
terms. Goods are classified as for “purposes of production”
or for “mere enjoyment,”<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c010'><sup>[598]</sup></a> but here again no theory of capital is
developed. Yet these two definitions are sufficient evidence that
he advanced beyond his predecessors in his apprehension of the
meaning of the term.<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c010'><sup>[599]</sup></a> His division of production and finance,
however, into the natural or limited, which deals only with natural
resources,<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c010'><sup>[600]</sup></a> and the unnatural, which is unlimited, and includes
commerce, usury, and even industry,<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c010'><sup>[601]</sup></a> reveals a mind neither greatly
interested in capital, nor clear as to its true economic importance.
His assertion in the <i>Ethics</i><a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c010'><sup>[602]</sup></a> that the prodigal (ἄσωτος) benefits many
by his reckless expenditures, and that parsimoniousness (ἀνελευθερία)
is a worse evil than prodigality also shows that he did not
sufficiently emphasize the importance to society of economy, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>mother of stored capital. On this point, Plato has the saner view,<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c010'><sup>[603]</sup></a>
and the extreme attitude of Aristotle is certainly not characteristic
of the Greeks in general.<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c010'><sup>[604]</sup></a> His failure to grasp the true theory of
interest is a further evidence of his superficial apprehension of the
function of money capital. He does not see, with Adam Smith,
that money represents so much stored capital, potentially productive,
and that “since something can everywhere be made by
the use of money, something ought everywhere to be paid for the
use of it.”<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c010'><sup>[605]</sup></a> In justice to him, however, it should be observed that,
though he failed to see the importance of unlimited economic progress
through constant increase in the capitalistic stock, there is
after all a sense in which he was right. There is a natural limit to
just acquisition, and it is especially with the individual in relation
to wealth that he is dealing. He is thus, with Plato, a forerunner of
the present tendency in economics, which is inclined to set a limit to
the amount that one can justly earn in a lifetime by his own work.<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c010'><sup>[606]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><i>Labor and industry.</i>—Aristotle’s attitude to labor, the third
factor in production, is similar to that of Plato, though he lays
greater emphasis on the evil physical and moral effect of the
“banausic” arts. They are defined as those that “render men
unfit for the practice of virtue.”<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c010'><sup>[607]</sup></a> They not only cause the body
to degenerate,<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c010'><sup>[608]</sup></a> but, being “mercenary” employments, they also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>vulgarize the soul.<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c010'><sup>[609]</sup></a> The occupations that require the most
physical labor are the most “slavish.”<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c010'><sup>[610]</sup></a> The life of artisans and
laborers is mean (φαῦλος) and has no business with virtue.<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c010'><sup>[611]</sup></a> The
citizen youth should be taught none of the illiberal pursuits of
the tradesmen.<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c010'><sup>[612]</sup></a> No citizen should enter into industrial labor or
retail trade, since they are ignoble (ἀγεννής) and hostile to virtue.<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c010'><sup>[613]</sup></a>
Even all the agricultural work must be performed by slaves, that
the citizens may have leisure for personal development and for
service to the state.<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c010'><sup>[614]</sup></a> In addition to his other objections to retail
trade and the arts, Aristotle considers them to be naturally unjust,
since they take something from him with whom they deal.<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c010'><sup>[615]</sup></a> Indeed,
the productive classes have but slight recognition in his ideal state.
They seem to be tolerated only as a necessary evil, and are in a
state of limited slavery ἀφωρισμένην τινὰ δουλείαν. Virtue is
even less possible for them than for slaves, and they lead a less
tolerable life.<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c010'><sup>[616]</sup></a> All hired labor belongs to the category of “false
finance” which degrades individual and state alike.<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c010'><sup>[617]</sup></a> The state
that produces a multitude of mechanics and but few hoplites can
never be great.<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c010'><sup>[618]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Here we have the very antithesis of the modern commercial
standpoint. However, the truth is not all with the moderns, for
a highly developed commerce and industry and the general prosperity
of the mass of the people are not always necessarily coincident.
Moreover, it is hardly fair to interpret Aristotle too rigidly.
He understood well the necessity of craftsmen and all other industrial
workers to the state.<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c010'><sup>[619]</sup></a> The burden of his attack was directed
against retail trade. Like Plato’s his prejudice had a moral and
political root,<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c010'><sup>[620]</sup></a> and was arrayed against the extreme application
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>to labor, and against its false purpose, rather than against labor
itself. He insisted that even intellectual work, when carried to an
extreme, and pursued with the wrong aim, might become equally
demoralizing.<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c010'><sup>[621]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Here is a doctrine which our modern age, that would place even
education on a bread-and-butter basis, and that tends to kill
initiative and vision by extreme specialization, might well consider.
Even Latin literature, when taught as it too often is, merely
as a syntactical grind to prepare teachers to pursue the same folly
is no more one of the humanities than is industrial chemistry.<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c010'><sup>[622]</sup></a>
Furthermore, Aristotle and Plato are doubtless right in their belief
that a necessary extreme application to physical labor to earn the
daily bread inevitably prevents mental and moral development
and the proper performance of the duties of citizenship. And our
modern democracies with their boasts of universal suffrage are
still something of a farce, as long as economic conditions are such
that the mass of the population has left no time to think of anything,
except how to provide the bare physical necessities. Aristotle’s
insistence upon leisure for the life of the citizen is no demand
for aristocratic indolence.<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c010'><sup>[623]</sup></a> Neither is it Jowett’s “condition of
a gentleman,” or merely the idealized notion of an “internal
state” in which “the intellect, free from the cares of practical life,
energizes or reposes in the consciousness of truth.” It is rather
a demand for release from material cares, so as to insure the highest
degree of activity in self-development and political service.<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c010'><sup>[624]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It may well be observed too, that Aristotle, the special champion
of slavery, and reputed scorner of physical labor for freemen,
exhibits a real interest in industry, in unguarded moments. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>of his arguments against communism is that it would take from the
citizen the desire to work.<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c010'><sup>[625]</sup></a> He repudiates the life of indolence,
and finds happiness in action.<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c010'><sup>[626]</sup></a> He considers a practical knowledge
of agriculture as essential to the successful economist,<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c010'><sup>[627]</sup></a> and defines
the just as those who live upon their own resources or labor, instead
of making profit from others, especially the farmers, who live from
the land which they cultivate.<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c010'><sup>[628]</sup></a> We have seen above also that he
makes labor one of the prime factors that determine value, and
thus the most important element in production.<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c010'><sup>[629]</sup></a> Moreover, he
shows that he has a practical grasp of the importance of productive
employment for the citizens of a democracy. He advises the rich
to furnish plots of land (γήδια) to the poor, from the public revenues,
or else that they give the poor a start (ἀφορμή) in other business,
and thus turn them to industry.<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c010'><sup>[630]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>On the division of labor, Aristotle adds little to Plato’s and
Xenophon’s theory. He agrees with Xenophon against Plato that
it implies a necessary distinction between the work of men and
women.<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c010'><sup>[631]</sup></a> He also applies the principle more extensively, so as to
include all nature, whereas Plato seems to limit its application to
man. Nature (ἡ φύσις) he observes, does not produce things like
the Delphian knife, in a poverty-stricken manner (πενιχρῶς) to
serve many purposes, but each for a single purpose (ἓν πρὸς ἓν).<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c010'><sup>[632]</sup></a>
Like Plato, he makes the principle of reciprocity (τὸ ἴσον ἀντιπεπονθός)
out of which the division of labor arises, the saving element
in the state.<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c010'><sup>[633]</sup></a> He is also fully as emphatic in his application of the
law to politics and citizenship.<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c010'><sup>[634]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>We have seen that the references to slavery in Xenophon and
Plato are incidental, and reveal a certain unconscious naïveté as
to the actual social problem involved. By Aristotle’s day, however,
the criticisms of the Sophists had shaken the foundations of
all traditional institutions, and their thesis that slavery is contrary
to nature had become through the Cynics a prominent social
theory.<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c010'><sup>[635]</sup></a> The thought on the subject had crystallized into two
leading doctrines—one including benevolence in justice, and hence
denying the right of slavery; and the other identifying justice
with the rule of the stronger, and hence upholding slavery as based
on mere force.<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c010'><sup>[636]</sup></a> The practical Aristotle, an upholder of slavery,
not from tradition, but through conscious belief in its economic
necessity, thus takes his stand midway between the two opposing
theories. He champions the old view of natural slavery, but
rejects the basis of mere force for that of morality and benevolence.<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c010'><sup>[637]</sup></a>
His thesis is that slavery is a natural and necessary relation in
human society, not accidental or conventional. The slave, being
property, which is a multitude of instruments (ὀργάνων πλῆθος),
is an animate instrument (ὄργανον ἔμψυχον) conducive to life (πρὸς
ζωήν).<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c010'><sup>[638]</sup></a> He is just as necessary to the best life of the citizen as are
inanimate instruments, and will be, until all tools work automatically,
like the mythical figures of Daedalus or the tripods of
Hephaestus.<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c010'><sup>[639]</sup></a> The slave is a servant in the realm of action (πρᾶξις),
not of production (ποίησις). He is not a producer of commodities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>(ποιητικός), but of services (πρακτικός),<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c010'><sup>[640]</sup></a> and just as property is
merely a part or member (μόριον) belonging wholly to something
else, so the slave, as property, belongs entirely to his master, and
has no true existence apart from him.<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c010'><sup>[641]</sup></a> From these facts, the
whole nature and power of the slave are evident. One who,
though a human being, is merely property is a natural slave, since
he is naturally not his own master, but belongs to another, in
whom he finds his true being.<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c010'><sup>[642]</sup></a> As Barker has observed, this conclusion
of the first part of Aristotle’s argument is inevitable if we
admit his premises of the identity of “instruments” and property,
but this is an unreal identity.<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c010'><sup>[643]</sup></a> “Natural” (φύσει) is the saving
word in his argument, but “human” (ἄνθρωπος) refutes it, as the
philosopher practically admits later.</p>

<p class='c002'>He now proceeds to ask the question whether this “natural”
slave of his hypothesis actually exists, for whom such a relation
is just, or whether all slavery is contrary to nature, as some allege.
He answers in the affirmative. The principle of rule and subjection
he declares to be a foundation law of all life.<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c010'><sup>[644]</sup></a> Men are constituted
for either condition from birth, and their development
follows this natural bent.<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c010'><sup>[645]</sup></a> This law may be observed in inanimate
things,<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c010'><sup>[646]</sup></a> in the natural subordinate relation of the body to the soul,
of domestic animals to man, of female to male, of child to parent,
and of subjects to rulers.<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c010'><sup>[647]</sup></a> Thus all who are capable only of
physical service hold the same relation to higher natures as the
body holds to the soul, and are slaves by nature.<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c010'><sup>[648]</sup></a> This is the only
relation for which the slave is naturally fitted, since he can apprehend
reason without himself possessing it, being midway between
animals and truly rational men.<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c010'><sup>[649]</sup></a> Usually also nature differentiates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>both the bodies and the souls of freemen and slaves, suiting
them to their respective spheres and functions.<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c010'><sup>[650]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>This relation of slavery, Aristotle argues, is not only natural
and necessary, but also beneficial for those who are so constituted.<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c010'><sup>[651]</sup></a>
Just as the body is benefited by the rule of the soul, and domestic
animals by the rule of man, so it is distinctly to the advantage of
the “natural slave” to be ruled by a rational master. This is
universally true, wherever one class of persons is as inferior to
another as is the body to the soul.<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c010'><sup>[652]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The philosopher’s frank admissions, in which he opposes the
doctrine that slavery is founded on mere force, are fatal to his
first argument on the natural slave. He admits that nature does
not always consummate her purpose; that the souls of freemen
are sometimes found in the bodies of slaves, and vice versa;<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c010'><sup>[653]</sup></a> that
it is difficult to distinguish the quality of the soul, in any event;<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c010'><sup>[654]</sup></a>
that the claim that slavery is neither natural nor beneficial has
in it a modicum of truth, as there are sometimes merely legal slaves,
or slaves by convention;<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c010'><sup>[655]</sup></a> that slavery based on mere might without
virtue is unjust;<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c010'><sup>[656]</sup></a> that captives of war may be wrongly enslaved;<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c010'><sup>[657]</sup></a>
that only those who actually deserve it, should meet this fate;<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c010'><sup>[658]</sup></a>
that the accidents of life may bring even the noblest of mankind
into slavery;<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c010'><sup>[659]</sup></a> and that only non-Greeks are ignoble and worthy
of it.<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c010'><sup>[660]</sup></a> He even insists that the terms “slave-master,” “freeman,”
“slave,” when rightly used, imply a certain virtue or the lack of it,
and therefore that to be justly a master, one must be morally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>superior.<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c010'><sup>[661]</sup></a> The question of the possession of the higher virtues
by slaves is recognized by him to be a difficult problem, for an
affirmative answer breaks down his distinction of “natural”
slave, yet it seems paradoxical to deny these virtues to him as a
human being.<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c010'><sup>[662]</sup></a> Nor can the difficulty be avoided by positing for
the slave a mere difference in degree of virtue, for the distinction
between ruler and subject must be one of kind.<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c010'><sup>[663]</sup></a> In any event,
temperance and justice are necessary even for good slave service.<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c010'><sup>[664]</sup></a>
Aristotle therefore evades the difficulty, and begs the question by
concluding that both master and slave must share in virtue, but
differently, in accord with their respective stations.<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c010'><sup>[665]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>With this admission, he places slaves on a higher plane than
free artisans, in that he denies virtue to such classes, since it cannot
be produced in them, except as they are brought into contact with
a master.<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c010'><sup>[666]</sup></a> He thus makes slavery a humanitarian institution,
and the slave a real member of the family.<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c010'><sup>[667]</sup></a> But the admission
most fatal to his theory is in agreeing that the slave <i>qua</i> man may
be a subject of friendship,<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c010'><sup>[668]</sup></a> and in advocating his manumission
as a reward for good behavior. With this, the attempted distinction
between him, <i>qua</i> slave and <i>qua</i> man, utterly breaks down,
and the existence of natural slaves is virtually denied.<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c010'><sup>[669]</sup></a> Thus the
great champion of slavery in the ancient world, by his very defense
of it, repudiates its right as a natural institution. His actual
conception of the relation is, indeed, not far from the ideal of Plato,
a union for the best mutual service of rulers and ruled, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the slave receives from his master a moral exchange value for his
physical service.<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c010'><sup>[670]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>There is a certain economic and moral truth, also, in the attitude
of Aristotle toward slavery, that, as Ruskin has observed,<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c010'><sup>[671]</sup></a> higher
civilization and culture must have a foundation of menial labor,
and that the only justification of such a situation is in the assumption
that some are naturally fitted for the higher, and some for the
lower, sphere.<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c010'><sup>[672]</sup></a> Such modern laborers are not technically slaves,
but Aristotle would insist that they are in a still worse condition,
since they are deprived of the humanizing and moralizing influences
of a rational master. The plausibility of such a contention would
be well illustrated by the wretched condition of multitudes of
negroes after the Civil War, as also by the hopeless life of a large
portion of the modern industrial army. Moreover, the economic
slavery of many of the common toilers today is less justifiable than
the domestic slavery advocated by Aristotle, for it too often means
a life of indolence and self-indulgence for the masters, instead of
that Greek leisure which gave opportunity for higher activity.<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c010'><sup>[673]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>MONEY</h3>
<p class='c006'>To the theory of money Aristotle makes a substantial contribution.
He agrees with Plato that money found its origin in the
growth of necessary exchange, which in turn resulted from an
increased division of labor. Unlike Plato, however, he gives
a detailed history of the development of money.<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c010'><sup>[674]</sup></a> Before its
invention, all exchange was by barter.<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c010'><sup>[675]</sup></a> But with the growth of
commerce, barter became difficult, and a common medium of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>exchange was agreed upon.<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c010'><sup>[676]</sup></a> Something was chosen that was
a commodity, having intrinsic value (ὁτῶν χρησίμων αὐτὸ ὄν) and
that was easy to handle (εὐμεταχείριστον) in the business of life
such as iron, silver, or other metal.<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c010'><sup>[677]</sup></a> It was first uncoined, defined
merely by size and weight.<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c010'><sup>[678]</sup></a> Finally, to avoid the inconvenience,
it was given a stamp (χαρακτήρ) representative of the quantity
(σημεῖον τοῦ πόσου).<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c010'><sup>[679]</sup></a> Thus arose the use of money as a convenience
in necessary exchange, but once having arisen, it became the
foundation of false finance and retail trade, which are pursued as
a science of gain.<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c010'><sup>[680]</sup></a> All this accords well with the facts as now
accepted, yet how utterly different is Aristotle’s standpoint from
that of the modern historian of economic institutions is revealed
by his last statement, and indeed by the setting of the entire passage.
His history of money is merely incidental to his purpose of showing
that money is the parent and the very life of the false finance
which he decries.</p>

<p class='c002'>He is also more explicit than the other Greek theorists on the
function of money. He clearly recognizes the two functions noted
by Plato,<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c010'><sup>[681]</sup></a> but he deals with them in a much more detailed manner.
His discussion grows out of his theory of distributive justice presented
in the <i>Ethics</i>.<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c010'><sup>[682]</sup></a> Money was introduced as the exchangeable
representative of demand (ὑπάλλαγμα τῆς χρείας),<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c010'><sup>[683]</sup></a> since diverse
products must be reduced to some common denominator.<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c010'><sup>[684]</sup></a> It is
thus a medium of exchange, acting as a measure of all inferior and
superior values, by making them all commensurable (συμβλητά).<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c010'><sup>[685]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>The other important function of money recognized is as a guaranty
(ἐγγυητής) of future exchange. It represents the abiding,
rather than the temporary, need, and is thus a standard of deferred
payments.<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c010'><sup>[686]</sup></a> The importance of money in the fulfilment of these
functions is great, in the opinion of Aristotle. The possibility of
fair exchange, or indeed the very existence of organized society
depends upon it.<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c010'><sup>[687]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>He is also clearer than Plato and Xenophon in his definition
of the relation between money and wealth. He severely criticizes
the current mercantilistic theory of his day, which identified
wealth with a quantity of current coin (νομίσματος πλῆθος).<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c010'><sup>[688]</sup></a> He
immediately follows this, however, with a more extended presentation
of the opposite error of the Cynics, that money is mere
trash (λῆρος), depending for its value entirely upon convention
(νόμῳ). This theory, he points out, is based on the fact that, if
money ceased to be recognized as legal tender, it would be useless;
that it satisfies no direct necessity; and that one might starve
like Midas, though possessed of it in superabundance.<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c010'><sup>[689]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Aristotle is here somewhat ambiguous as to his own attitude
toward this doctrine. He fails to object that money does not
necessarily become valueless when it ceases to be legal tender, and
that a similar argument might be used to prove that clothing is
not wealth. Instead, he uses the idea as a means of refuting the
opposite error, which is more obnoxious to him, and on the basis
of it he plunges into his discussion of the true and false finance.<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c010'><sup>[690]</sup></a>
This, together with a passage in the <i>Ethics</i>, might point to the conclusion
that he agreed with the doctrine of the Cynics on money.
He states that it was introduced by agreement (κατὰ συνθήκην);
that, owing to this, it is called νόμισμα, because its value is not
natural but legal; and that it may, at any time, be changed or made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>useless.<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c010'><sup>[691]</sup></a> In the light of other evidence, however, it seems probable
that he here meant to emphasize merely the fact that the general
agreement of a community is necessary before anything can be
used as a symbol of demand. In stating that it may be made
useless, he probably referred to money itself, rather than the
material of it, which is, of course, true. His determined opposition
to the mercantile theory of money, as the basis of false
finance, caused him to appear to subscribe to the opposite error.
That, in actual fact, he did recognize the necessity of intrinsic
value as an attribute of money is clearly evidenced by another
passage, where he specifies it. He says that the material chosen
as money was a commodity and easy to handle.<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c010'><sup>[692]</sup></a> This can mean
only that it is subject to demand and supply, like any other object
of exchange. This inference is substantiated by another passage,
which declares that the value of money fluctuates, like that of other
things, only not in the same degree.<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c010'><sup>[693]</sup></a> Moreover, in his enumeration
of the diverse kinds of wealth, money is regularly included.<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c010'><sup>[694]</sup></a> It
seems evident, therefore, that he did not fall a victim of either
error, but recognized that, though money is only representative
wealth, yet it is itself a commodity, whose value changes with
supply and demand, like other goods.<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c010'><sup>[695]</sup></a> Since he understood the
use of money as a standard of deferred payments, he also saw
clearly the necessity of a stable monetary standard.<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c010'><sup>[696]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Though Aristotle defines money as representative wealth, like
Plato, he fails to apprehend its meaning as representative, and
therefore productive capital.<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c010'><sup>[697]</sup></a> In his eyes, such a use of money is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>unjust and contrary to nature. He counts usury (τοκισμός) to be
a large part of that false finance, which turns money from its true
function to be made an object of traffic.<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c010'><sup>[698]</sup></a> Those who lend small
sums at a high rate of interest are contemptible,<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c010'><sup>[699]</sup></a> and petty
usury (ἡ ὀβολοστατική) is the most unnatural and violent form of
chrematistik, since it makes money reproduce money.<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c010'><sup>[700]</sup></a> It is to be
observed, however, that his criticism is directed chiefly against
petty interest, and that he does not appear to be thinking of
“heavy loans on the security of a whole cargo, but of petty
lendings to the necessitous poor, at heavy interest.”<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c010'><sup>[701]</sup></a> Though
his entire account of false finance exhibits an animus against
the precious metals, as its basal cause, and as the source of individual
and national degeneration,<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c010'><sup>[702]</sup></a> yet he clearly appreciates their
necessary function in the state, and his hostility is actually
directed against the spirit of commercialism. Money, the means,
has usurped the place of the end, until domestic and public
economy alike have come to mean only the vulgar art of
acquisition.<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c010'><sup>[703]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The usual explanation of the fact that the Greek theorists
failed to grasp the fact of the productive power of money is that
loans were almost entirely for consumption, and hence seemed like
an oppression of the poor.<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c010'><sup>[704]</sup></a> This explanation, however, does not
accord with the facts of Athenian life, at least for Aristotle’s day.
It is clear from the <i>Private Orations</i> of Demosthenes that there
did exist an extensive banking and credit system for productive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>purposes in the Athens of his time.<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c010'><sup>[705]</sup></a> Moreover, the hostility to
interest and credit was not the rule, but the exception, for Demosthenes
and not the philosophers should be accepted as voicing
public opinion on this point. He considered credit to be of as
much importance as money itself in the business world,<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c010'><sup>[706]</sup></a> and
declared one who ignored this elementary fact to be a mere know-nothing.<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c010'><sup>[707]</sup></a>
Indeed, the money-lenders were, to him, the very
foundation of the prosperity of the state.<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c010'><sup>[708]</sup></a> The prejudice of Plato
and Aristotle represent merely the exceptional attitude of the
pure moralist, who because of the questionable tactics of money-lenders,
and the injustice and greed in some phases of contemporary
business life, became critics of all money-making operations.<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c010'><sup>[709]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>EXCHANGE</h3>
<p class='c006'>Aristotle, in both the <i>Politics</i> and the <i>Ethics</i>, deals at considerable
length with the subject of exchange.<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c010'><sup>[710]</sup></a> He states that it
arose out of the natural situation (κατὰ φύσιν) and defines this
as “the fact that men had more of some commodities and less of
others than they needed.”<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c010'><sup>[711]</sup></a> At first, all exchange was by barter
(ἀλλαγή) and there was no trading except for specific need.<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c010'><sup>[712]</sup></a> The
development of an international commerce of import and export
was made possible by the invention of money. It is this significant
fact that furnishes the line of division between the old natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>economy and the era of commerce and finance, when exchange
and money have become the tools for unlimited individual enrichment.<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c010'><sup>[713]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>His theory of exchange and just price grows out of his application
to exchange of his definition of corrective justice, as a mean
between two extremes of injustice.<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c010'><sup>[714]</sup></a> Trade is just when each party
to it has the exact equivalent (ἴσον) in value with which he began.
Exchange is a mean between profit and loss, which themselves
have no proper relation to its true purpose.<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c010'><sup>[715]</sup></a> This does not mean
that the traders must receive the same in return (τὸ ἀντιπεπονθὸς
κατ᾽ ἰσότητα), but an equivalent, or proportional requital (τὸ ἀντιπεπονθὸς
κατ᾽ ἀναλογίαν).<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c010'><sup>[716]</sup></a> It is this fact of proportional requital
that makes exchange, and indeed human society, possible.<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c010'><sup>[717]</sup></a> The
meaning is illustrated by a proportion in which the producers bear
the same relation to each other as their products.<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c010'><sup>[718]</sup></a> By joining
means and extremes, the exchangers are brought to a basis of proportional
equality (τὸ κατὰ τὴν ἀναλογίαν ἴσον).<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c010'><sup>[719]</sup></a> Thus is determined
how many shoes, the shoemaker’s product, must be given for
a house, the builder’s product, and the prices of the two commodities
are justly settled, with relation to each other.<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c010'><sup>[720]</sup></a> It is very
necessary for just exchange, that such proportional equality be
effected before the requital or actual transfer takes place. Otherwise
one will gain both superiorities (ἀμφοτέρας τὰς ὑπεροχάς), and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>equality becomes impossible,<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c010'><sup>[721]</sup></a> since the cost of production of things
is very diverse.<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c010'><sup>[722]</sup></a> Indeed, the arts themselves could not exist,
unless the advantage to the consumer were similar in quantity
and quality to the cost to the producer.<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c010'><sup>[723]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The common element in diverse products that makes them
commensurable is need, or demand (ἡ χρεία), for reciprocal services.<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c010'><sup>[724]</sup></a>
But on the basis of the need of the moment, or under the régime of
barter, just exchange would be practically impossible, since the
concrete needs of A and B, at any given moment, are not likely to
correspond. In such a case, exchange would be a gross disregard
of the cost of production. This has been avoided by the introduction
of money as a substitute for demand,<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c010'><sup>[725]</sup></a> a symbol of general,
rather than specific need. Thus just exchange becomes possible,
for money, as the representative of general need, is always equally
in demand by all, and, as the common denominator of value, it
alone renders it possible for proportional amounts of each product
to be exchanged.<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c010'><sup>[726]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Aristotle’s basal premise in this theory of fair exchange, that
unless an equal quantum of value is received by each party, one
must lose what the other gains, has been severely criticized by
Menger.<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c010'><sup>[727]</sup></a> He objects that the determining consideration in
exchange is not the equal value of exchanged goods. On the contrary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>men trade only when they expect to better their economic
condition. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Um ihres economischen Vortheils willen, nicht um
gleiches gegen gleiches hinzugeben; sondern um ihre Bedürfnisse
so vollständig als unter den gegebenen Verhältnissen dies zulässig
ist zu befriedigen.”</span> Each gives the other only so much of his own
goods as is necessary to secure this end, and it is this competition
in open market that fixes prices. Barker<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c010'><sup>[728]</sup></a> also criticizes Aristotle
on the ground that he takes no account of demand in his theory of
just price. He states that if the cost of production were the only
element to be considered, the doctrine might be correct, but with
the entrance of demand, one may buy at a low price and sell at an
advance without injustice.</p>

<p class='c002'>Of course, the bald theory that, in exchange, one necessarily
loses what the other gains, is untenable. Yet there is still something
to be said for Aristotle. He recognized, as well as Menger,
that exchange, as pursued by the retailers, did not square with his
idea of just price. This is the very reason why he objects to retail
trade. He is presenting exchange, not as it is, but as he believes
it should be pursued. His doctrine, in a nutshell, is that the primary
purpose of exchange is profit, <i>defined as economic satisfaction
of mutual needs</i>, not profit in dollars and cents. The equality that
he seeks, too, is not so much an equality of value in obols and
drachmas, but that each shall receive an equal quantum of economic
satisfaction. This is the true standpoint at bottom, and
when, as is common, the mere purpose of money-making dominates
in the pursuit of exchange, the profit is too often at the
expense of the other party. Such exchange certainly does not
mean economic advance or general prosperity. It merely makes
possible an increase in the inequalities of wealth and poverty.
There is much of fallacy in the prevalent idea that business necessarily
increases the wealth of a state. Ruskin, though like Aristotle
extreme and one-sided in his view, struck at the root of this
error. He also declared that the result of exchange should be
advantage, not profit, and repudiated the idea that the mere fact
that goods change hands necessarily means general enrichment.<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c010'><sup>[729]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The central truth in their protest needed to be spoken, though both
erred in not sufficiently recognizing that the labor involved in
exchange creates an added time and place value, and therefore
has a right to be called productive. They also failed to observe
the fact of the necessary risk involved in the business of exchange,
which should be repaid with a fair additional profit. For the
cornering of markets and the manipulation of prices, for the sake
of individual enrichment, modern economists and statesmen, with
Aristotle and Ruskin, are fast coming to have only words of protest.</p>

<p class='c002'>Moreover, contrary to Barker’s assertion, demand, as an element
of price, is prominent throughout this discussion of Aristotle.
He objects, however, to allowing the effect of demand to overcome
unduly the cost of production, thus causing inequality and injustice.
According to his idea, each receives the equivalent in value of what
he gives, in the sense that it is a resultant of the proportionate
influence of both cost and need.<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c010'><sup>[730]</sup></a> We may, nevertheless, observe
an excellent example of inconsistency in the fact that, despite his
insistence upon just exchange, he appears to treat monopoly as
a legitimate principle of finance for both men and states,<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c010'><sup>[731]</sup></a> though
his intention in the passage may have been to discuss actual conditions,
rather than to idealize.</p>

<p class='c002'>Naturally, the philosopher shows no concern for a tax on
imports as a means of building up the industry and commerce of
his state, since he is especially desirous of limiting both. However,
he is not blind to the advantages of export and import trade
for a nation,<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c010'><sup>[732]</sup></a> but would regulate them with an ethical, rather than
an economic purpose.<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c010'><sup>[733]</sup></a> His doctrine of exchange as a form of
production has been discussed above,<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c010'><sup>[734]</sup></a> and will be touched upon
further in the following pages. His general criticism of what he
terms “false finance” or “chrematistik” (χρηματιστική) remains
for more extended treatment.</p>

<p class='c002'>We have seen that he recognizes the necessity of a limited form
of exchange, free from the purpose of gain, and considers such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>trading to be natural and in accord with that interdependence
which nature demands.<a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c010'><sup>[735]</sup></a> He calls it the very bond of the social
organization,<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c010'><sup>[736]</sup></a> and even considers international commerce to be
necessary for the prosperity of a state.<a id='r737' /><a href='#f737' class='c010'><sup>[737]</sup></a> We have also seen that
he goes so far as to advise the rich in a democracy to give the poor
a start in business,<a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c010'><sup>[738]</sup></a> but that exchange, in its prevalent form, is
to him a method of cheatery, in which one gains what the other
loses.<a id='r739' /><a href='#f739' class='c010'><sup>[739]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>On the basis of this prejudice, he builds his argument for
domestic economy (οἰκονομική) as opposed to false finance.<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c010'><sup>[740]</sup></a> We
will therefore consider his entire theory of this relation at this
point, for the term “chrematistik,” though more inclusive than
exchange (μεταβλητική), has trade in either goods or money (καπηλική)
as its predominating element, and the two terms are often
used by him as synonyms. He employs the word χρηματιστική
in several significations—usually of unnatural finance, or the art
of money-making by exchange of goods or money; sometimes as
synonymous with κτητική, the general term for the entire business
of acquisition, including both natural and unnatural finance;<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c010'><sup>[741]</sup></a>
again, of the natural finance, which is a part of domestic economy.
His confusion results partly from his futile attempt to separate
landed property from general industry and commerce.</p>

<p class='c002'>His main contention is that there is a vital distinction between
domestic economy, whether of householder (οἰκονόμος) or statesman,
and the art of acquisition or finance, as usually pursued.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>The primary function of the art of finance is to provide, while that
of domestic economy is to use what is provided.<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c010'><sup>[742]</sup></a> There are,
however, many methods of acquisition (κτητική; χρηματιστική),
some of which truly belong to the sphere of domestic economy.<a id='r743' /><a href='#f743' class='c010'><sup>[743]</sup></a>
The provision of all that is furnished by nature herself, as necessary
to human existence, then, if not already at hand (ὑπάρχειν),
belongs properly to domestic economy.<a id='r744' /><a href='#f744' class='c010'><sup>[744]</sup></a> It both uses and provides
genuine wealth, such as is limited in amount (οὐκ ἄπειρος)
yet sufficient for independence (αὐτάρκεια) and the good life.<a id='r745' /><a href='#f745' class='c010'><sup>[745]</sup></a>
But the use of such wealth is its chief business.<a id='r746' /><a href='#f746' class='c010'><sup>[746]</sup></a> The other kind
of acquisition, which is unlimited, or chrematistik, is contrary to
nature, and is not in the province of domestic economy.<a id='r747' /><a href='#f747' class='c010'><sup>[747]</sup></a> This
unnatural finance, since it deals chiefly in the exchange of money
and other commodities, may be termed retail trade (καπηλική).<a id='r748' /><a href='#f748' class='c010'><sup>[748]</sup></a>
Though itself false, it is a logical outgrowth (κατὰ λόγον) of the
true form of exchange that is limited to actual needs<a id='r749' /><a href='#f749' class='c010'><sup>[749]</sup></a> as a result of
the invention of money.<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c010'><sup>[750]</sup></a> But the real reason for its pursuit is to
satisfy an evil and unlimited desire for material things.<a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c010'><sup>[751]</sup></a> It
produces money merely through the exchange of money (δι1α
χρημάτων μεταβολῆς),[##] and its beginning and end is unlimited
currency.<a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c010'><sup>[752]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>This false form of acquisition is often confused with necessary
exchange, because both deal with money.<a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c010'><sup>[753]</sup></a> Their aims, however,
are quite diverse. The latter treats the accumulation of money
(αὔξησις) as a means, while the former treats it as the supreme end
of life.<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c010'><sup>[754]</sup></a> In fine, then, Aristotle teaches that necessary chrematistik
has to do with the supply and use of life’s necessities, is natural
(κατὰ φύσιν or οἰκειοτάτη) and limited,<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c010'><sup>[755]</sup></a> its prime function being
the proper disposal of products.<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c010'><sup>[756]</sup></a> It is an honorable pursuit,<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c010'><sup>[757]</sup></a>
dependent chiefly upon fruits and animals,<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c010'><sup>[758]</sup></a> and involves a practical
knowledge of stock (κτηνή), farming, bee-culture, trees, fish, and
fowl.<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c010'><sup>[759]</sup></a> The false finance, on the other hand, is unnatural, dishonorable,
and enriches at the expense of another.<a id='r760' /><a href='#f760' class='c010'><sup>[760]</sup></a> Its chief
business is commerce (ἐμπορία), including sea-trade (ναυκληρία),
inland trade (φορτηγία), and shop-trade, (παράστασις).<a id='r761' /><a href='#f761' class='c010'><sup>[761]</sup></a> It also
comprises usury (τοκισμός) and hired labor, both skilled and
unskilled (μισθαρνία ἡ μὲν τῶν βαναύσων τέχνων ἡ δὲ ἀτεχνῶν).<a id='r762' /><a href='#f762' class='c010'><sup>[762]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Aristotle also distinguishes a third type of finance (χρηματιστική)
which shares in the nature of both those above described.
It deals with natural resources and their products, but with things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>which, though useful, are not fruits (ἀκάρπιμα), such as wood-cutting
(ὑλοτομία) and mining in all its branches (μεταλλευτική).<a id='r763' /><a href='#f763' class='c010'><sup>[763]</sup></a>
The meaning may be best apprehended if, with Ashley,<a id='r764' /><a href='#f764' class='c010'><sup>[764]</sup></a> we observe
that οἰκονομική is characterized, not only by direct acquisition of
nature’s products, but also by a personal use of the same, while the
unnatural finance has neither of these qualities. The medium
kind, then, is like the former, in that it involves direct acquisition
of natural resources, but like the latter, in that it does not acquire
for directly personal use, but for exchange. It consists, therefore,
not so much in the arts themselves, as in the exchange that is based
on them.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the discussion of the so-called false finance, Aristotle thus
reveals a markedly hostile attitude to any extensive development
of exchange. The middleman is considered to be a parasite and
necessarily degenerate by the very fact of his business.<a id='r765' /><a href='#f765' class='c010'><sup>[765]</sup></a> As seen
above, his criticism was doubtless directed chiefly against the mean
and dishonest spirit in the actual retail trade and money-loaning
of his day.<a id='r766' /><a href='#f766' class='c010'><sup>[766]</sup></a> Yet here also, just as in the <i>Ethics</i> passage above
discussed, his prejudice blinds him to the fact that exchangers may
be real producers, and that, after all, even the alleged false finance
is not unlimited, but that it is distinctly bounded by economic
demand.<a id='r767' /><a href='#f767' class='c010'><sup>[767]</sup></a> Still worse, he includes hired labor of every kind under
unlimited acquisition, merely because it has some of the other
qualities of that type of economy, though it certainly does not
tend to unlimited enrichment even as much as agriculture.<a id='r768' /><a href='#f768' class='c010'><sup>[768]</sup></a> However,
he should be given credit of being a forerunner of the modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>humanitarian economy, which insists that the final goal of all
economics should be proper consumption, and that acquisition
must be relegated to its true place as a means, the supreme end
being human welfare.<a id='r769' /><a href='#f769' class='c010'><sup>[769]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>POPULATION</h3>
<p class='c006'>Aristotle exhibits an interest in the problem of population in
relation to subsistence in his criticism of Plato for limiting the
amount of property and making it indivisible, while failing to
provide against a too high birth-rate.<a id='r770' /><a href='#f770' class='c010'><sup>[770]</sup></a> He states the principle
that, if property is to be limited, there must be a corresponding
limitation on the increase of population,<a id='r771' /><a href='#f771' class='c010'><sup>[771]</sup></a> and that the let-alone
policy must be followed by increased poverty.<a id='r772' /><a href='#f772' class='c010'><sup>[772]</sup></a> He therefore
criticizes the Spartan law, for encouraging the largest possible
families.<a id='r773' /><a href='#f773' class='c010'><sup>[773]</sup></a> It is evident, however, that, as in the case of Plato, his
interest in the problem is prompted chiefly by a moral and political
motive. It arises merely from his desire to limit individual
acquisition, in a small state, artificially constructed, and is to him
in no sense a question of world food-supply.<a id='r774' /><a href='#f774' class='c010'><sup>[774]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>DISTRIBUTION</h3>
<p class='c006'>In the <i>Ethics</i> passage discussed above,<a id='r775' /><a href='#f775' class='c010'><sup>[775]</sup></a> Aristotle approaches
a scientific theory of distribution. He observes that just distribution
will be a mean between two extremes of unfairness.<a id='r776' /><a href='#f776' class='c010'><sup>[776]</sup></a> Unlike
some moderns, however, he realizes that this will not mean
equal shares for all. There must be the same ratio between the
persons, or services, and the things.<a id='r777' /><a href='#f777' class='c010'><sup>[777]</sup></a> In the “mutual exchange of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>services,” the law must be proportional requital.<a id='r778' /><a href='#f778' class='c010'><sup>[778]</sup></a> In other words,
each should receive an equivalent to what he contributes.<a id='r779' /><a href='#f779' class='c010'><sup>[779]</sup></a> Distribution
must thus proceed according to a certain standard of
worth or desert (κατ᾽ ἀξίαν τινά).<a id='r780' /><a href='#f780' class='c010'><sup>[780]</sup></a> If the individuals are unequal,
their shares cannot be equal, and it is a prolific source of dispute,
whenever equals receive unequal shares, or unequals receive equal.<a id='r781' /><a href='#f781' class='c010'><sup>[781]</sup></a>
On the other hand, Aristotle recognizes that it is a difficult matter
to determine this standard, by which just distribution is to proceed.<a id='r782' /><a href='#f782' class='c010'><sup>[782]</sup></a>
At this point, again, he shows clearly that his paramount interest
in the problem is not economic. He names four possible standards—freedom,
wealth, noble birth, and general excellence—all
of which are distinctly political in their reference.<a id='r783' /><a href='#f783' class='c010'><sup>[783]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Though he insists on a fair distribution of wealth to the citizens,
he can hardly be said to exhibit as much interest in the welfare
of the common people as does Plato. He had not a very ideal
conception of human nature in general. He would have thought
it not only impracticable, but undesirable to give his doctrine of
leisure any extensive application. As seen above, he includes all
hired labor under false finance, and relegates all industry, including
agriculture, to the slaves and strangers. The life of mechanic
and commercial alike is to him ignoble.<a id='r784' /><a href='#f784' class='c010'><sup>[784]</sup></a> He advises that measures
be taken to hold the workers in submission and obedience.<a id='r785' /><a href='#f785' class='c010'><sup>[785]</sup></a> His
unfair criticism of Plato’s <i>Republic</i>, however, on the ground that
it fails to emphasize sufficiently the welfare of the parts of the state,
and that it does not distinguish clearly enough the status of the
commons, reveals a spirit that does not entirely disregard the
masses.<a id='r786' /><a href='#f786' class='c010'><sup>[786]</sup></a> His demand that no citizen shall lack subsistence,<a id='r787' /><a href='#f787' class='c010'><sup>[787]</sup></a> his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>provision of the <i>sussitia</i> for all,<a id='r788' /><a href='#f788' class='c010'><sup>[788]</sup></a> his insistence that, in the market,
mere economic self-interest shall not rule,<a id='r789' /><a href='#f789' class='c010'><sup>[789]</sup></a> and his emphasis on the
importance of a strong middle class in the state,<a id='r790' /><a href='#f790' class='c010'><sup>[790]</sup></a> all show that, in
the interest of the perpetuity of the state at least, he had some
regard for the economic well-being of all classes. It would be
wrong to infer from his suggestions for the aid of the masses in
a democracy, that he would offer similar advice for the ideal state.
Moreover, his chief emphasis in the passage is upon the idea of
Mill, that mere hand-to-mouth help of the poor is wasteful, and
that what is needed is to aid them to become economically independent.<a id='r791' /><a href='#f791' class='c010'><sup>[791]</sup></a>
Nevertheless his suggestion does show that he saw
clearly the relation that exists in a democracy between the economic
condition of the masses and the stability of the state.<a id='r792' /><a href='#f792' class='c010'><sup>[792]</sup></a> He
says that the genuine friend of the people (ἀληθινῶς δημοτικός) will
see that the masses are not very poor, for the best assurance of the
abiding welfare of the state is the solid prosperity of the great
majority of the population. He therefore advises the rich to contribute
money for furnishing plots of land or capital for small
business enterprises to the needy poor.<a id='r793' /><a href='#f793' class='c010'><sup>[793]</sup></a> However, while the
advice seems, on the surface, to favor the commons, it is really
a prudent suggestion to the upper classes, appealing to their selfish
interest to avoid by this method the danger of a discontented proletariat.<a id='r794' /><a href='#f794' class='c010'><sup>[794]</sup></a>
Nevertheless, the general economic attitude of Aristotle
would warrant including him, with the other Greek thinkers, in
the statement of Roscher: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Die hellenische Volkswirtschaftslehre
hat niemals den grossen Fehler begangen, über dem Reichtume die
Menschen zu vergessen, und über der Vermehrung der Menschenzahl,
der Wohlstand der einzelnen gering zu achten.”</span><a id='r795' /><a href='#f795' class='c010'><sup>[795]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Aristotle makes clear his attitude toward the institution of
private property and other related questions, both in his criticism
of other thinkers, and in his own positive suggestions for the ideal
state. Through his objections to the systems of Phaleas and
Plato, he has acquired the reputation of being the great defender
of private property in Greece. We shall see the extent to which
this interpretation of him is correct. Our consideration of his
theory may be summarized under certain topics which are fundamental
to the problem of distribution.</p>

<p class='c002'>He admits that the doctrine of economic equality may have
some wisdom in it.<a id='r796' /><a href='#f796' class='c010'><sup>[796]</sup></a> The attempt to equalize possessions may
tend slightly to prevent civic discord.<a id='r797' /><a href='#f797' class='c010'><sup>[797]</sup></a> Yet it is liable to arouse
sedition on the part of the exploited classes,<a id='r798' /><a href='#f798' class='c010'><sup>[798]</sup></a> and such relief measures
will satisfy the masses only for a time, for they are notoriously
insatiate.<a id='r799' /><a href='#f799' class='c010'><sup>[799]</sup></a> In his opinion, therefore, the saner remedy is equalization
of desires rather than of property,<a id='r800' /><a href='#f800' class='c010'><sup>[800]</sup></a> which must be realized by proper
education and a right constitution, whereby the upper classes
shall not oppress, and the masses shall be held in check. We have
here still a valid argument against the more radical type of socialism.
It is suggestive of the modern doctrine of private property
as a public trust,<a id='r801' /><a href='#f801' class='c010'><sup>[801]</sup></a> and presents clearly the antithesis between the
attitude of Greek thinkers and that of the modern social democracy.<a id='r802' /><a href='#f802' class='c010'><sup>[802]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Aristotle argues further that equalization of property would be
powerless to prevent anything more than the merely petty crimes,
for the grossest ones are the result of inordinate desire, rather than
of inability to provide life’s necessities.<a id='r803' /><a href='#f803' class='c010'><sup>[803]</sup></a> Moreover, there are
many other natural inequalities of life what would remain to arouse
discontent.<a id='r804' /><a href='#f804' class='c010'><sup>[804]</sup></a> This is a sensible observation that has often been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>overlooked by modern radical socialists, though its author might
have objected further that such personal diversities would also
render an abiding equality of property impossible. His previous
argument, however, that immorality and crimes are the result of
inordinate desire, rather than of economic need, might be answered
today by the results of investigations upon the relation of wages
to morality.</p>

<p class='c002'>The doctrine of communistic equality, as preached by some
theorists in fifth- and fourth-century Greece, and as satirized by
Aristophanes,<a id='r805' /><a href='#f805' class='c010'><sup>[805]</sup></a> had no appeal for Aristotle. It was, to him, merely
a thinly veiled individualism. He saw through the selfish partisanship
of both oligarchs and democrats, and recognized that all
men are poor judges in matters that concern themselves.<a id='r806' /><a href='#f806' class='c010'><sup>[806]</sup></a> The
excessive individualism of the radical democrat of his day, which
permitted the majority to confiscate the property of the minority
in the name of a false equality, was as hateful to him as it was to
Plato.<a id='r807' /><a href='#f807' class='c010'><sup>[807]</sup></a> As seen above, he insisted that economic or political
equality should not be demanded, except on the basis of equality
of service.<a id='r808' /><a href='#f808' class='c010'><sup>[808]</sup></a> Exploitation by the radical democracy was, in his
eyes, as bad as the rule of a tyrant,<a id='r809' /><a href='#f809' class='c010'><sup>[809]</sup></a> and the ruthless individualism
of the classes was no better.<a id='r810' /><a href='#f810' class='c010'><sup>[810]</sup></a> Like Plato, he would oppose to both
of these the common interest, and would unite both masses and
classes in the aim to realize the highest moral life for the individual
through the state.<a id='r811' /><a href='#f811' class='c010'><sup>[811]</sup></a> He refuted the Sophist’s theory of social contract
and of justice as a mere convention.<a id='r812' /><a href='#f812' class='c010'><sup>[812]</sup></a> As Stewart has observed
he realized that “more powerful causes than the mere perception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of material advantage brought men into social union and keep
them in it.”<a id='r813' /><a href='#f813' class='c010'><sup>[813]</sup></a> Each citizen, he held, is not his own master, but all
belong to the state. Each is a member (μόριον) of the social body,
and the concern of each is naturally relative to the good of the
whole.<a id='r814' /><a href='#f814' class='c010'><sup>[814]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Aristotle’s further criticisms, of minor significance, on the suggestions
of Phaleas and Plato for equality of possessions are as follows:
They have taken no precautions to regulate population accordingly.<a id='r815' /><a href='#f815' class='c010'><sup>[815]</sup></a>
They set no proper limit between luxury and penury for individual
possessions.<a id='r816' /><a href='#f816' class='c010'><sup>[816]</sup></a> Plato’s system is not thoroughgoing, since it allows
inequalities in personal property, a criticism also valid against his
own proposals.<a id='r817' /><a href='#f817' class='c010'><sup>[817]</sup></a> Phaleas failed to include personal property in his
system of equality.<a id='r818' /><a href='#f818' class='c010'><sup>[818]</sup></a> Such strictures seem to proceed from his
pedantic desire to criticize inconsistency. However, he may have
apprehended more clearly than did Plato the danger of the press
of poverty that must eventually result from a system like that of
the <i>Laws</i>.<a id='r819' /><a href='#f819' class='c010'><sup>[819]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Our author is also strong in his denial of either the wisdom or
feasibility of the communism in the <i>Republic</i>.<a id='r820' /><a href='#f820' class='c010'><sup>[820]</sup></a> He argues that
Plato’s proposed family communism is based upon the false principle
that a state must be composed of like elements,<a id='r821' /><a href='#f821' class='c010'><sup>[821]</sup></a> and shows
that it must fail to accomplish its end of harmony, for Plato’s
“all” must mean all collectively.<a id='r822' /><a href='#f822' class='c010'><sup>[822]</sup></a> But this must result, if realized,
in a decrease of devotion,<a id='r823' /><a href='#f823' class='c010'><sup>[823]</sup></a> and thus in a lack of the very harmony
sought,<a id='r824' /><a href='#f824' class='c010'><sup>[824]</sup></a> since one of the chief sources of attachment in the
world is exclusive ownership.<a id='r825' /><a href='#f825' class='c010'><sup>[825]</sup></a> He would deem such a measure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>therefore, more fitting for the third class, since a weakening of
their ties of affection might result in greater submission to the
rulers,<a id='r826' /><a href='#f826' class='c010'><sup>[826]</sup></a> another striking evidence of the gulf that separates the
ideal of Greek political thought from the spirit of modern democracy.</p>

<p class='c002'>Moreover, he considers Plato’s assumption that a state, to be
a unity, must be devoid of all private interests, to be gratuitous,<a id='r827' /><a href='#f827' class='c010'><sup>[827]</sup></a>
and argues that the common possession of anything is more likely
to cause strife than harmony.<a id='r828' /><a href='#f828' class='c010'><sup>[828]</sup></a> In his opinion, the present system
of private property, if accompanied by a right moral tone and
proper laws, combines the advantages of both common and individual
ownership.<a id='r829' /><a href='#f829' class='c010'><sup>[829]</sup></a> The tenure of property should therefore be
private, but there should be a certain friendly community in its
actual use.<a id='r830' /><a href='#f830' class='c010'><sup>[830]</sup></a> Thus will be avoided the double evil of strife and
neglect, which must result from dissatisfaction and lack of personal
interest under communism.<a id='r831' /><a href='#f831' class='c010'><sup>[831]</sup></a> He offers as a substitute for
the Platonic doctrine, then, his own ideal of reciprocal equality
(τὸ ἴσον τὸ ἀντιπεπονθός) as the real cement of society.<a id='r832' /><a href='#f832' class='c010'><sup>[832]</sup></a> In any
event, he asserts, the present evils do not result from private
property, but from the depravity of human nature (μοχθηρίαν),<a id='r833' /><a href='#f833' class='c010'><sup>[833]</sup></a>
and the aim should be to improve this by moral and intellectual
culture, rather than to attempt amelioration by the establishment
of an entirely new system.<a id='r834' /><a href='#f834' class='c010'><sup>[834]</sup></a> The latter method would result, even
if successful, not only in escape from some of the present evils, but
also in the loss of the present advantages of private tenure.<a id='r835' /><a href='#f835' class='c010'><sup>[835]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The foregoing arguments all show remarkable practical insight,
and have been common in the modern criticism of socialism. The
objection that individual effort and industry would be paralyzed
if bereft of the stimulus of personal interest and ownership, while
a general fact of human nature, need not be valid against a system
where each has opportunity to develop up to his capacity. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>is certainly little to impel the great mass of people to industry
under an individualistic system, except the proverbial wolf at the
door. But Aristotle is not thinking of the masses. The objection
that the evils result from human nature, not from the economic
system, may well be pondered by modern socialists and doctrinaire
reformers, yet this very fact is an additional reason why the system
should be reformed so as to curb such wrong tendencies. The
emphasis upon education as a cure for the existing ills is wise, and
it might well be more fully recognized by modern socialists, though
both Aristotle and later critics of proposed social reforms are wrong
in implying that the two methods are mutually exclusive. The
warning that, by giving up the régime of private properly, we
should not only be rid of its evils, but also lose its advantages,
should be pondered by agitators against the existing economic
system. Modern socialists might also learn much from Aristotle
and the other Greek thinkers in regard to the true social ideal, as
not primarily materialistic and selfish, but moral and social. On
the whole, it may be observed that Aristotle’s criticism of Plato’s
alleged communism in the <i>Republic</i> would be far more applicable
against modern socialism.</p>

<p class='c002'>As to the <i>sussitia</i>, Aristotle proposes a system similar to that of
Plato’s <i>Laws</i>.<a id='r836' /><a href='#f836' class='c010'><sup>[836]</sup></a> He harshly criticizes the Spartan method, which
required every citizen, rich and poor alike, to contribute to the
common meals on pain of loss of citizenship.<a id='r837' /><a href='#f837' class='c010'><sup>[837]</sup></a> He praises, on the
other hand, the Cretan system, which permitted the entire citizenship,
including women and children, to be nourished at the common
table, at public expense.<a id='r838' /><a href='#f838' class='c010'><sup>[838]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>We have seen that Plato, in the <i>Laws</i>, while apparently granting
private property in land, really denies this, since he makes the
product of the land practically public property.<a id='r839' /><a href='#f839' class='c010'><sup>[839]</sup></a> Aristotle, despite
his strictures against communism, advocates a system of land
tenure quite similar. His limitation of the freedom of donation
or testament, purchase or sale; his demands that the lot shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>never leave the family, that it shall always be handed down by
legitimate succession, and that no citizen shall ever be allowed to
hold more than one allotment, are all Platonic, and make him
unquestionably an advocate of family, rather than of private
ownership of land.<a id='r840' /><a href='#f840' class='c010'><sup>[840]</sup></a> His collectivism is more direct than that of
the <i>Laws</i>, since he makes part of the land entirely public, to defray
the expense of worship and the common meals.<a id='r841' /><a href='#f841' class='c010'><sup>[841]</sup></a> The assignment
of lots to the citizens is on the same terms as in the <i>Laws</i>, with the
exception that the owners are masters of the product of their lots.<a id='r842' /><a href='#f842' class='c010'><sup>[842]</sup></a>
Despite his criticism of Plato’s division of homesteads, he has the
same plan.<a id='r843' /><a href='#f843' class='c010'><sup>[843]</sup></a> As in the <i>Laws</i>, only citizens are landowners, and this
includes only the governing and military classes,<a id='r844' /><a href='#f844' class='c010'><sup>[844]</sup></a> while all husbandmen
are to be public or private slaves.<a id='r845' /><a href='#f845' class='c010'><sup>[845]</sup></a> Unlike Plato, however,
Aristotle does not attempt to avoid undue inequalities in
personal property.<a id='r846' /><a href='#f846' class='c010'><sup>[846]</sup></a> He sets no maximum above which limit goods
must be confiscated, nor does he, as Plato, establish a rigorous
system of laws to hamper trade and to make money-making operations
practically impossible. He recognizes that such regulations
are not feasible, and his legislation is therefore more considerate of
human nature, despite the fact that his hostility to the ideal of
commercialism is even more pronounced than is that of Plato.<a id='r847' /><a href='#f847' class='c010'><sup>[847]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It is evident from the preceding outline of Aristotle’s negative
and positive doctrine on the matter of private property that his
system is in substantial agreement with that of Plato’s second state.<a id='r848' /><a href='#f848' class='c010'><sup>[848]</sup></a>
Besides the points of similarity noted above, he agrees with his
predecessor in emphasizing strongly the power of the state over
the life of the citizens. Both insist that the citizen belongs, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>to himself, but to the state, and can realize his best life only through
the state.<a id='r849' /><a href='#f849' class='c010'><sup>[849]</sup></a> Thus Aristotle is far from being a defender of private
property in the absolute sense. On the other hand, his emphasis
upon the social obligation of individual possession is, if not socialistic,
at least very modern. He is certainly a much better socialist
than the alleged communist of the <i>Republic</i>, whom he criticizes
so severely. Like the Plato of the <i>Laws</i>, he is a semi-collectivist.
As Barker has observed,<a id='r850' /><a href='#f850' class='c010'><sup>[850]</sup></a> Aristotle thought in terms of land, while
modern socialism thinks in terms of capital and labor. Both
standpoints involve social ownership and the limitation of the individual,
and in this respect the Greek thinker was socialistic in
tendency. But despite their social spirit and their trend toward
nationalism, which is so strong in all progressive countries today,
neither he nor Plato was a socialist, in the modern sense, in spirit or
in aim.<a id='r851' /><a href='#f851' class='c010'><sup>[851]</sup></a> Any attempts at direct comparison with modern socialism,
therefore, are likely to be fanciful and confusing. Whatever
analogy there is between them is of a very general nature and
should not be pressed.<a id='r852' /><a href='#f852' class='c010'><sup>[852]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 id='chap7' class='c005' title='VII. Minor Philosophers.'>CHAPTER VII <br /> MINOR PHILOSOPHERS, CONTEMPORARIES OR SUCCESSORS OF PLATO AND ARISTOTLE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The minor philosophers, contemporaries or successors of the
Socratics, present in their extant fragments some ideas on wealth
and other economic problems that are worthy of note. For purposes
of convenience, we shall group them all here, though some of
them would chronologically precede one or both of the greater
philosophers. The successors of Plato in the Academy, Speusippus,
Xenocrates, and Crantor,<a id='r853' /><a href='#f853' class='c010'><sup>[853]</sup></a> carried forward the teaching of the
Socratics on wealth, as opposed to the more extreme doctrine of the
Cynics and Stoics.<a id='r854' /><a href='#f854' class='c010'><sup>[854]</sup></a> There was, however, probably less emphasis
on matters economic in their writings, since their prime interest
was in practical individual ethics rather than in the political morality
of Plato and Aristotle, though Xenocrates is known to have
written an <i>Economicus</i>.<a id='r855' /><a href='#f855' class='c010'><sup>[855]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Theophrastus,<a id='r856' /><a href='#f856' class='c010'><sup>[856]</sup></a> the first and greatest successor of Aristotle in
the Peripatetic school, was the author of a treatise on wealth, of
which we know only the name.<a id='r857' /><a href='#f857' class='c010'><sup>[857]</sup></a> He also probably dealt somewhat
with economic subjects in his <i>Ethics</i> and <i>Politics</i>, but only slight
fragments of either work are extant. He reveals slightly greater
regard for the importance of external goods than Aristotle, perhaps
because of his special love for the quiet and leisure of the scholar’s
life.<a id='r858' /><a href='#f858' class='c010'><sup>[858]</sup></a> There is, however, no evidence that he went so far as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>ascribe a positive value to wealth as such. On the contrary, he
advises that one render himself independent of it by living a simple
life,<a id='r859' /><a href='#f859' class='c010'><sup>[859]</sup></a> and urges against vulgar display.<a id='r860' /><a href='#f860' class='c010'><sup>[860]</sup></a> Like Aristotle, he prefers
moderate wealth,<a id='r861' /><a href='#f861' class='c010'><sup>[861]</sup></a> and finds its chief value in the fact that it
enables one to have the distinction of giving splendid gifts to the
people.<a id='r862' /><a href='#f862' class='c010'><sup>[862]</sup></a> He approaches the cosmopolitan spirit of the Stoics in
his emphasis upon the natural relationship of all men,<a id='r863' /><a href='#f863' class='c010'><sup>[863]</sup></a> a result of
the broadening vision due to the unification of Greece under the
Macedonian Empire. There is nothing of interest from other
members of the Peripatetic school, except the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>
and <i>Magna moralia</i>, which were included in our discussion of Aristotle,
and the pseudo-Aristotelian <i>Economica</i>, which will be discussed
in the following pages.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>THE ECONOMICA</h3>
<p class='c006'><i>Economica</i> were one of the characteristic types of Greek literature,
after the <i>Economicus</i> of Xenophon.<a id='r864' /><a href='#f864' class='c010'><sup>[864]</sup></a> They discussed wealth
from the ethical standpoint, dealt largely with domestic, rather
than public, economy, and considered questions of human relations,
such as slavery and the married life. They are, in general, imitations
of Xenophon and of Aristotle’s <i>Politics</i>, and add very little
of interest to the economic theory of the Socratics. Aside from the
work, falsely ascribed to Aristotle, to be discussed below, <i>Economica</i>
were written by Antisthenes,<a id='r865' /><a href='#f865' class='c010'><sup>[865]</sup></a> Xenocrates,<a id='r866' /><a href='#f866' class='c010'><sup>[866]</sup></a> Philodemus,<a id='r867' /><a href='#f867' class='c010'><sup>[867]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Metrodorus of Lampsacus,<a id='r868' /><a href='#f868' class='c010'><sup>[868]</sup></a> Hierocles,<a id='r869' /><a href='#f869' class='c010'><sup>[869]</sup></a> Dio Chrysostom,<a id='r870' /><a href='#f870' class='c010'><sup>[870]</sup></a> Plutarch,<a id='r871' /><a href='#f871' class='c010'><sup>[871]</sup></a>
and the New-Pythagoreans,<a id='r872' /><a href='#f872' class='c010'><sup>[872]</sup></a> Bryson,<a id='r873' /><a href='#f873' class='c010'><sup>[873]</sup></a> Callicratidas,<a id='r874' /><a href='#f874' class='c010'><sup>[874]</sup></a> Periktione,<a id='r875' /><a href='#f875' class='c010'><sup>[875]</sup></a>
and Phintys.<a id='r876' /><a href='#f876' class='c010'><sup>[876]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The pseudo-Aristotelian <i>Economica</i><a id='r877' /><a href='#f877' class='c010'><sup>[877]</sup></a> require no extended discussion,
since most of the material that is of interest in them is an
imitation of Aristotle’s <i>Politics</i> and Xenophon’s <i>Economics</i>. Book i
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>is largely a repetition of some of Aristotle’s theories of domestic
economy, the marriage relation, and slavery, with a few unimportant
additions and slight differences.<a id='r878' /><a href='#f878' class='c010'><sup>[878]</sup></a> Book ii is almost entirely
composed of practical examples of how necessary funds have been
provided by states and rulers.</p>

<p class='c002'>The most distinctive point about the doctrine of the first book
is its separation of οἰκονομική from πολιτική as a special science.<a id='r879' /><a href='#f879' class='c010'><sup>[879]</sup></a>
The author agrees with Aristotle, however, that it is the function
of economics both to acquire and to use, though without his specific
limitations upon acquisition.<a id='r880' /><a href='#f880' class='c010'><sup>[880]</sup></a> He distinguishes four forms of
economy—acquiring, guarding, using, and arranging in proper
order.<a id='r881' /><a href='#f881' class='c010'><sup>[881]</sup></a> Elsewhere, he makes a different classification on another
basis—imperial, provincial, public, and private.<a id='r882' /><a href='#f882' class='c010'><sup>[882]</sup></a> These are each
further subdivided, the first including finance, export and import
commerce, and expenditures.<a id='r883' /><a href='#f883' class='c010'><sup>[883]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Agriculture is especially eulogized by the author, in the spirit
of Xenophon and Aristotle. It is the primary means of natural
acquisition, the others being mining and allied arts whose source
of wealth is the land.<a id='r884' /><a href='#f884' class='c010'><sup>[884]</sup></a> It is the most just acquisition, since it is not
gained from men, either by trade, hired labor, or war,<a id='r885' /><a href='#f885' class='c010'><sup>[885]</sup></a> and it contributes
most to manly strength.<a id='r886' /><a href='#f886' class='c010'><sup>[886]</sup></a> Retail trade and the banausic
arts, on the other hand, are both contrary to nature,<a id='r887' /><a href='#f887' class='c010'><sup>[887]</sup></a> since they
render the body weak and inefficient (ἀχρεῖα).<a id='r888' /><a href='#f888' class='c010'><sup>[888]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The work agrees with Aristotle, against Plato, in his doctrine
that men and women are essentially different in nature, and hence
that their work should be distinct.<a id='r889' /><a href='#f889' class='c010'><sup>[889]</sup></a> No attempt is made to justify
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>slavery, though Aristotle is followed in his advice to grant emancipation,
as a special reward for faithfulness.<a id='r890' /><a href='#f890' class='c010'><sup>[890]</sup></a> The author of
Book ii seems to have taken for granted the Cynic theory that
money need have no intrinsic value, at least for local purposes.
Coinage of iron,<a id='r891' /><a href='#f891' class='c010'><sup>[891]</sup></a> tin,<a id='r892' /><a href='#f892' class='c010'><sup>[892]</sup></a> bronze,<a id='r893' /><a href='#f893' class='c010'><sup>[893]</sup></a> the arbitrary stamping of drachmas
with a double value,<a id='r894' /><a href='#f894' class='c010'><sup>[894]</sup></a> are all offered apparently as a proper means
of escape from financial difficulty. Like Aristotle, he accepts
monopoly as a shrewd and legitimate principle of finance.<a id='r895' /><a href='#f895' class='c010'><sup>[895]</sup></a> Elsewhere,
however, in striking contrast to such uneconomic suggestions,
the author states the important economic principle that
expenditures should not exceed income.<a id='r896' /><a href='#f896' class='c010'><sup>[896]</sup></a> In accord with Greek
usage, he is familiar with a tax on exports for revenue and as a
means of guarding against depletion of supply.<a id='r897' /><a href='#f897' class='c010'><sup>[897]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>CYRENAICS</h3>
<p class='c006'>The Cyrenaics were the forerunners of the Epicureans in their
more liberal attitude toward wealth. Aristippus,<a id='r898' /><a href='#f898' class='c010'><sup>[898]</sup></a> the founder of
the school, was a man of the world, who believed in enjoying life
as it came.<a id='r899' /><a href='#f899' class='c010'><sup>[899]</sup></a> He held that pleasure was always a good, and that
all else was of value only as a means of realizing this end.<a id='r900' /><a href='#f900' class='c010'><sup>[900]</sup></a> If consistent,
therefore, he must have valued highly moderate wealth.
His principle that one should aim to realize the highest degree of
pleasure with the least economic expenditure is somewhat analogous
to the modern economic doctrine of the smallest means.<a id='r901' /><a href='#f901' class='c010'><sup>[901]</sup></a>
Bion of Borysthenes became a Cyrenaic in his later life, but his
satires are almost entirely lost.<a id='r902' /><a href='#f902' class='c010'><sup>[902]</sup></a></p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>EPICURUS AND HIS SCHOOL</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Epicurus, though the apostle of hedonism, and heir of the
Cyrenaics, taught a doctrine of wealth somewhat similar to that of
the Stoics.<a id='r903' /><a href='#f903' class='c010'><sup>[903]</sup></a> His “happiness” consisted in living a simple and
prudent life. He taught that spiritual wealth is unlimited, and
that the wise are contented with things easy to acquire (εὐπόριστα);<a id='r904' /><a href='#f904' class='c010'><sup>[904]</sup></a>
that external wealth, on the other hand, is limited,<a id='r905' /><a href='#f905' class='c010'><sup>[905]</sup></a> and that it is
not increase of possessions but limitation of desires that makes
truly rich.<a id='r906' /><a href='#f906' class='c010'><sup>[906]</sup></a> He believed the simplest food to be best,<a id='r907' /><a href='#f907' class='c010'><sup>[907]</sup></a> both for
pleasure and for health, that many wealthy find no escape from ills,<a id='r908' /><a href='#f908' class='c010'><sup>[908]</sup></a>
that he who is not satisfied with little will not be satisfied with all,<a id='r909' /><a href='#f909' class='c010'><sup>[909]</sup></a>
and that contented poverty is the greatest wealth.<a id='r910' /><a href='#f910' class='c010'><sup>[910]</sup></a> In accord
with his teaching, he seems to have lived very simply.<a id='r911' /><a href='#f911' class='c010'><sup>[911]</sup></a> However,
he did not go to the extreme of the Cynics and Stoics, but taught
that the wise will have a care to gain property, and not live as
beggars.<a id='r912' /><a href='#f912' class='c010'><sup>[912]</sup></a> He exhibits no tendency toward communism, but
rather toward the extreme individualism of the Sophists, and was
in sympathy with their social contract theory.<a id='r913' /><a href='#f913' class='c010'><sup>[913]</sup></a> Later Epicureanism
degenerated by taking the hedonistic principle of its founder too
literally. Like the Sophists, the school has influenced modern
economic thought through its conception of justice, as a mere
convention for mutual advantage.<a id='r914' /><a href='#f914' class='c010'><sup>[914]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>The Cynics developed the negative attitude of the Socratics
toward wealth to its extreme in asceticism. Their doctrine was subversive
of all economic interest. Antisthenes, the founder of the
school, was a contemporary of Plato, a Sophist in his youth, but
later associated with the Socratic circle. He appears prominently
in the <i>Symposium</i> of Xenophon.<a id='r915' /><a href='#f915' class='c010'><sup>[915]</sup></a> He urged a return to nature
in the literal sense.<a id='r916' /><a href='#f916' class='c010'><sup>[916]</sup></a> His book on the nature of animals (περὶ ζώων
φύσεως) probably presented examples from the animal world as
models for natural human living. Like many writers of his time
and later, he idealized the life of primitive and barbarous peoples.<a id='r917' /><a href='#f917' class='c010'><sup>[917]</sup></a>
In utter antithesis to Aristotle,<a id='r918' /><a href='#f918' class='c010'><sup>[918]</sup></a> he declared city life and civilization
to be the source of all injustice, luxury, and corruption.
In his opinion, Zeus punished Prometheus, not because he envied
men any good, but because the discovery of fire was the source
(ἀφορμή) of all effeminacy and luxury for men.<a id='r919' /><a href='#f919' class='c010'><sup>[919]</sup></a> Material wealth
was, to him, if not an absolute evil, something about which men
should be entirely indifferent, for in essence, good and evil could have
only a moral reference.<a id='r920' /><a href='#f920' class='c010'><sup>[920]</sup></a> The craving for wealth or power was a
vain illusion. Nothing was good for a man except what was actually
his own,<a id='r921' /><a href='#f921' class='c010'><sup>[921]</sup></a> and this was to be found only in the soul.<a id='r922' /><a href='#f922' class='c010'><sup>[922]</sup></a> Wealth without
virtue was not only worthless, but a fruitful source of evil,<a id='r923' /><a href='#f923' class='c010'><sup>[923]</sup></a> and no
lover of money could be either virtuous or free.<a id='r924' /><a href='#f924' class='c010'><sup>[924]</sup></a> He thus advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>beyond the Socratic doctrine of ability to use as the criterion of
value.</p>

<p class='c002'>However, though despising wealth, Antisthenes upheld the
dignity of free labor. He believed it to be a good by which alone
virtue is gained, the source of independence.<a id='r925' /><a href='#f925' class='c010'><sup>[925]</sup></a> Like the rest of the
Cynics, he was thus doubtless opposed to slavery. The Cynic
principle that all diversities in men, except differences in moral
character, were merely accidental was a direct argument against
slavery.<a id='r926' /><a href='#f926' class='c010'><sup>[926]</sup></a> It is also probable that he held the Cynic doctrine that
intrinsic value in money is unnecessary.<a id='r927' /><a href='#f927' class='c010'><sup>[927]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Diogenes of Sinope, “the philosopher of the proletariat,” became
more famous than Antisthenes, owing to his eccentric personality.<a id='r928' /><a href='#f928' class='c010'><sup>[928]</sup></a>
He carried the Cynic doctrine of wealth to its <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>reductio ad absurdum</i></span>
by applying it literally in his own life. His repudiation of wealth
and civilization was even more emphatic than that of his predecessor.
He taught that wealth without virtue is worse than poverty.<a id='r929' /><a href='#f929' class='c010'><sup>[929]</sup></a>
Lovers of wealth are like men afflicted with the dropsy, always
athirst for more.<a id='r930' /><a href='#f930' class='c010'><sup>[930]</sup></a> The desire for money is the very source and
center (μητρόπολιν) of all ills.<a id='r931' /><a href='#f931' class='c010'><sup>[931]</sup></a> Virtue cannot dwell either in a
wealthy state or in a wealthy house.<a id='r932' /><a href='#f932' class='c010'><sup>[932]</sup></a> Poverty better accords with
it, and is no real cause of suffering.<a id='r933' /><a href='#f933' class='c010'><sup>[933]</sup></a> Truly noble men despise
wealth and are above being troubled by poverty and other so-called
ills.<a id='r934' /><a href='#f934' class='c010'><sup>[934]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Diogenes was doubtless opposed to slavery and taught that
under proper conditions of the simple life there would be no reason
for it.<a id='r935' /><a href='#f935' class='c010'><sup>[935]</sup></a> In his opinion, the truly free were not slaves, even though
they might be in a state of servitude, but the mean-spirited were
slavish even though free.<a id='r936' /><a href='#f936' class='c010'><sup>[936]</sup></a> He wrote a <i>Republic</i> in which he seems
to have advocated fiat money to take the place of the hated gold
and silver<a id='r937' /><a href='#f937' class='c010'><sup>[937]</sup></a> and to prevent the extensive accumulation of movable
wealth. He also advocated the community of wives and children,<a id='r938' /><a href='#f938' class='c010'><sup>[938]</sup></a>
and perhaps some system of land tenure other than private ownership.<a id='r939' /><a href='#f939' class='c010'><sup>[939]</sup></a>
Crates, the poet of the Cynics,<a id='r940' /><a href='#f940' class='c010'><sup>[940]</sup></a> expresses similar sentiments
of scorn for wealth, supreme regard for virtue,<a id='r941' /><a href='#f941' class='c010'><sup>[941]</sup></a> and glorification of
poverty,<a id='r942' /><a href='#f942' class='c010'><sup>[942]</sup></a> Menippus and Monimus left little of economic interest.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>“ERYXIAS”</h3>
<p class='c006'>The pseudo-Platonic dialogue, <i>Eryxias</i>, is of special interest
for our study, since it is the only extant work in Greek literature
which deals directly and exclusively with the problem of wealth.<a id='r943' /><a href='#f943' class='c010'><sup>[943]</sup></a>
The work presents nothing new, however, which had not already
been observed by the Socratics. The statement of Heidel,<a id='r944' /><a href='#f944' class='c010'><sup>[944]</sup></a> that
it is “distinctly the most valuable contribution of antiquity to
the science of political economy,” is therefore an exaggeration.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Nevertheless, the essay is worthy of more notice than it has usually
received in histories of ancient economic thought.<a id='r945' /><a href='#f945' class='c010'><sup>[945]</sup></a> Whatever
consideration has been given to it has been largely devoted to the
question of its origin. It reveals points of contact with Plato, the
later Socratics, and especially with Antisthenes, the Cynic, with
whom the author seems to have been most in sympathy.<a id='r946' /><a href='#f946' class='c010'><sup>[946]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The two theses that form the goal of the <i>Eryxias</i> are that the
wisest men are in reality the wealthiest, and that material wealth
is an evil, since they who possess most of it are the most needy of
all, and hence most depraved.<a id='r947' /><a href='#f947' class='c010'><sup>[947]</sup></a> The keynote of the dialogue is the
question of Socrates concerning the wealthy Sicilian, “What sort
of a man was he reputed to be in Sicily?”<a id='r948' /><a href='#f948' class='c010'><sup>[948]</sup></a> The double thesis is
illustrated concretely by Socrates, the wisest, and the Sicilian,
the richest but worst of men. The first idea is prominent in
Euthydemus,<a id='r949' /><a href='#f949' class='c010'><sup>[949]</sup></a> and elsewhere in Plato and Xenophon.<a id='r950' /><a href='#f950' class='c010'><sup>[950]</sup></a> The second
is a favorite doctrine of the Cynics and Stoics,<a id='r951' /><a href='#f951' class='c010'><sup>[951]</sup></a> though the general
thought may be traced back to Socrates.<a id='r952' /><a href='#f952' class='c010'><sup>[952]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Some insight is exhibited by the author into the problem of
value. Like Xenophon, he defines property (χρήματα) as that which
is useful, and thus recognizes this element in value.<a id='r953' /><a href='#f953' class='c010'><sup>[953]</sup></a> He also distinguishes
general from economic utility.<a id='r954' /><a href='#f954' class='c010'><sup>[954]</sup></a> In answer to the question
in respect to what particular use wealth possesses utility, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>states tentatively that it is with respect to bodily needs,<a id='r955' /><a href='#f955' class='c010'><sup>[955]</sup></a> an idea
suggestive of the organon theory of Aristotle. By this, he doubtless
means food, clothing, and shelter, which have the quality of rarity.
This, however, is only a step in the argument, which has for its
goal the thesis that intellectual attainments constitute the most
important part of one’s wealth, and possess a very real economic
value.<a id='r956' /><a href='#f956' class='c010'><sup>[956]</sup></a> The author thus agrees with Plato, Xenophon, the Cynics,
and the Stoics, in his emphasis upon spiritual goods. The distinction
between value in use and value in exchange and the necessary
dependence of the latter upon the former are also suggested
in the statement that nothing can have economic value except as
there is a demand for it. The money that passes current in one
state may be valueless in another, as also would be the mansion of
the wealthy Polytion to Scythian nomads, since there would be
no demand for them.<a id='r957' /><a href='#f957' class='c010'><sup>[957]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The <i>Eryxias</i> has no clear or satisfactory definition of wealth.
It is recognized that wealth must be defined before its character
as good or evil can be determined, but the final answer nowhere
appears.<a id='r958' /><a href='#f958' class='c010'><sup>[958]</sup></a> In this vagueness of result, one is strongly reminded of
some of Plato’s minor dialogues. There is also a certain ambiguity
throughout the work, similar to that observed in Plato,<a id='r959' /><a href='#f959' class='c010'><sup>[959]</sup></a> between
wealth in its strict economic sense and excessive wealth. We may
gather from the course of the argument, however, that the author
would define wealth as consisting of things that possess utility, and
are subjects of economic demand, whether external, physical, or
intellectual goods.</p>

<p class='c002'>The attitude of the <i>Eryxias</i> toward wealth is an extreme version
of that with which we have become familiar in the Socratics,
and is best characterized as Cynic. As seen above, the author
considers external wealth to be an absolute second to wisdom,<a id='r960' /><a href='#f960' class='c010'><sup>[960]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>since wisdom is not only itself a means of providing material needs,<a id='r961' /><a href='#f961' class='c010'><sup>[961]</sup></a>
but also and especially because through it alone does any material
wealth become truly valuable.<a id='r962' /><a href='#f962' class='c010'><sup>[962]</sup></a> When the latter is made the
<i>summum bonum</i>, it becomes the greatest evil. Like Plato, Jesus,
and Ruskin, he insists that the kingdom of wisdom be given the
first place,<a id='r963' /><a href='#f963' class='c010'><sup>[963]</sup></a> for things derive their good or evil quality from the
character or knowledge of the user.<a id='r964' /><a href='#f964' class='c010'><sup>[964]</sup></a> The ironical account of how
the Greek fathers, even of the best classes (τῶν μεγίστων δοκούντων)
urge their boys to seek wealth, since without this they are of no
account, is almost in the language of Pastor Wagner’s condemnation
of the extreme commercialism of this age.<a id='r965' /><a href='#f965' class='c010'><sup>[965]</sup></a> Material goods,
when unwisely used, are a fruitful source of ills,<a id='r966' /><a href='#f966' class='c010'><sup>[966]</sup></a> and excessive
wealth is always evil.<a id='r967' /><a href='#f967' class='c010'><sup>[967]</sup></a> However, the political motive, which
prompted the hostility of Plato and Aristotle to excessive wealth,
is absent from the <i>Eryxias</i>.</p>

<p class='c002'>Thus far the attitude of the author does not differ very essentially
from that of the Socratics, but toward the end of the dialogue
the doctrine is distinctly taught that wealth is an evil <i>per se</i>. He
argues that one’s needs are most numerous in a state of sickness,
when he is in his worst condition.<a id='r968' /><a href='#f968' class='c010'><sup>[968]</sup></a> One is at his best, on the other
hand, when he has fewest and simplest needs.<a id='r969' /><a href='#f969' class='c010'><sup>[969]</sup></a> But those who
have most property are sure to need the largest provision for the
service of the body.<a id='r970' /><a href='#f970' class='c010'><sup>[970]</sup></a> Thus the richest, as being the most needy,
are the most depraved (μοχθηρότατα διακείμενοι) and the most
unhappy, and therefore external wealth is essentially evil.<a id='r971' /><a href='#f971' class='c010'><sup>[971]</sup></a> Such
a characteristically Cynic doctrine is essentially ascetic, and subversive
of the very foundations of economics.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>The <i>Eryxias</i> hints at a definition of capital in the distinction
between the direct consumption of wealth and its use for further
production.<a id='r972' /><a href='#f972' class='c010'><sup>[972]</sup></a> But it is far from the author’s purpose to define
capital, and he makes nothing of the distinction. The relation of
money to wealth is also dealt with incidentally. Like Aristotle,
he criticizes the definition of wealth as “the possession of much
money,”<a id='r973' /><a href='#f973' class='c010'><sup>[973]</sup></a> on the ground that the money of one country may not
pass current in another, and hence cannot be true wealth.<a id='r974' /><a href='#f974' class='c010'><sup>[974]</sup></a> This is
suggestive of the Cynic theory of fiat money, since the examples
used are those of the worthless currency of Carthage, Sparta, and
Ethiopia.<a id='r975' /><a href='#f975' class='c010'><sup>[975]</sup></a> But the argument proves too much, since it would be
equally as effective against counting the house of Polytion as true
wealth. There is, moreover, a peculiar shift in this part of the
dialogue between money and property. The theory of the author
is further upheld by the argument that a condition can be conceived
in which our bodily needs might be supplied without silver or gold,
in which case these metals would be worthless.<a id='r976' /><a href='#f976' class='c010'><sup>[976]</sup></a> However, the
necessity of intrinsic value for international currency is recognized,<a id='r977' /><a href='#f977' class='c010'><sup>[977]</sup></a>
and it seems hardly probable that the purpose of the dialogue was
to contend that money is never wealth, since the very implication
of the argument is that current money is wealth.<a id='r978' /><a href='#f978' class='c010'><sup>[978]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c011'>TELES</h3>
<p class='c006'>The fragments of Teles exhibit the same extreme asceticism of
the Cynics in relation to wealth.<a id='r979' /><a href='#f979' class='c010'><sup>[979]</sup></a> His main thesis is that the possession
of money does not free from want and need.<a id='r980' /><a href='#f980' class='c010'><sup>[980]</sup></a> Many who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>have great possessions do not use them, because of stinginess and
sordidness.<a id='r981' /><a href='#f981' class='c010'><sup>[981]</sup></a> But if wealth is not used, it is useless, and cannot
free from need or want.<a id='r982' /><a href='#f982' class='c010'><sup>[982]</sup></a> Here we meet a different application of
the criterion of “use” from that with which we have become
familiar in the Socratics, the <i>Eryxias</i>, and Ruskin. It is based on
refusal, rather than inability to use, though the other idea is in the
background. The author argues further that wealth does not free
from need, because the wealthy life is always insatiate (ἄπληστος),<a id='r983' /><a href='#f983' class='c010'><sup>[983]</sup></a>
and wealth does not change the disposition,<a id='r984' /><a href='#f984' class='c010'><sup>[984]</sup></a> by which change alone
the life can be freed from need and slavery.<a id='r985' /><a href='#f985' class='c010'><sup>[985]</sup></a> To try to accomplish
this by wealth is like attempting to cure a patient of dropsy by stuffing
him with water until he bursts.<a id='r986' /><a href='#f986' class='c010'><sup>[986]</sup></a> Counsel is given, therefore, not
to turn one’s sons to the acquisition of wealth, but to study under
Crates, who can set them free from the vice of insatiety.<a id='r987' /><a href='#f987' class='c010'><sup>[987]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Poverty, on the other hand, does not change the disposition of
the temperate man for the worse<a id='r988' /><a href='#f988' class='c010'><sup>[988]</sup></a> There is nothing distressing or
painful about it,<a id='r989' /><a href='#f989' class='c010'><sup>[989]</sup></a> for Crates and Diogenes were poor and yet passed
their life in ease.<a id='r990' /><a href='#f990' class='c010'><sup>[990]</sup></a> It is no harder to endure old age in poverty
than in wealth, but all depends upon the disposition.<a id='r991' /><a href='#f991' class='c010'><sup>[991]</sup></a> Poverty
deprives the life of no positive good, but furnishes the opportunity
of gaining good,<a id='r992' /><a href='#f992' class='c010'><sup>[992]</sup></a> since it is conducive to the contemplative life of
philosophy, while wealth is an obstacle to this.<a id='r993' /><a href='#f993' class='c010'><sup>[993]</sup></a> It is the poor,
rather than the wealthy, who have leisure.<a id='r994' /><a href='#f994' class='c010'><sup>[994]</sup></a> They are also obliged
to be strong (καρτερεῖν), while the wealthy become effeminate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>since they have no impetus to work.<a id='r995' /><a href='#f995' class='c010'><sup>[995]</sup></a> Thus poverty, when accompanied
with justice, should be more highly honored than wealth.<a id='r996' /><a href='#f996' class='c010'><sup>[996]</sup></a>
The author concludes that it is therefore best to despise wealth
and turn to the life of philosophy, for this develops generosity
instead of stinginess, and contentment instead of insatiety. Such
a life uses what is on hand, and lives content with present
blessings (τοῖς παροῦσι).<a id='r997' /><a href='#f997' class='c010'><sup>[997]</sup></a> The marked contrast between this
ascetic philosophy of poverty and the saner teaching of Plato,
who was as much opposed to poverty as to excessive wealth, is
patent.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>STOICS</h3>
<p class='c006'>The Stoics were the natural descendants in thought of the
Cynics, whom they resemble closely in their attitude toward
external goods. According to their definition, a good must have an
unconditioned value (<i>absolutum</i>, αὐτελές). Whatever exists merely
for the sake of something else, or is of value only in comparison
to something else, is not a good.<a id='r998' /><a href='#f998' class='c010'><sup>[998]</sup></a> A similar doctrine was held
concerning evil. Thus spiritual goods were counted to be the
only true wealth,<a id='r999' /><a href='#f999' class='c010'><sup>[999]</sup></a> and he who had the right attitude toward
all,<a id='r1000' /><a href='#f1000' class='c010'><sup>[1000]</sup></a> and used all rightly, was thought to be the spiritual owner
of all.<a id='r1001' /><a href='#f1001' class='c010'><sup>[1001]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Zeno, the founder of the school,<a id='r1002' /><a href='#f1002' class='c010'><sup>[1002]</sup></a> classified both wealth and
poverty among the so-called “indifferents” (ἀδιάφορα),<a id='r1003' /><a href='#f1003' class='c010'><sup>[1003]</sup></a> as neither
good nor evil <i>per se</i>. Like the Cynics, he eulogized poverty,
though not to such an extreme degree.<a id='r1004' /><a href='#f1004' class='c010'><sup>[1004]</sup></a> He went with them only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>so far as to insist that wealth and poverty have no value, except
in relation to the proper spiritual attitude.<a id='r1005' /><a href='#f1005' class='c010'><sup>[1005]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>In his argument that temples are not especially holy places,
since they are the work of artisans (βαναύσων), Zeno exhibits the
common negative attitude of the philosophers toward manual
labor.<a id='r1006' /><a href='#f1006' class='c010'><sup>[1006]</sup></a> His doctrine on money and exchange was also the negative
teaching of the moralist, though his statements on these matters
have special reference to an ideal future.<a id='r1007' /><a href='#f1007' class='c010'><sup>[1007]</sup></a> His attitude on the
problem of distribution is not altogether clear, though he wrote
a <i>Republic</i>,<a id='r1008' /><a href='#f1008' class='c010'><sup>[1008]</sup></a> in which he seems to have presented some communistic
ideas. Like his followers, he looked to the time when the whole
world should be one state, where artificial differences were no more,
and all men were brothers.<a id='r1009' /><a href='#f1009' class='c010'><sup>[1009]</sup></a> His state is utopian and anarchistic,
without temple, court, gymnasium, money, or exchange. All are
to wear the same clothing, and there shall be no artificial modesty.<a id='r1010' /><a href='#f1010' class='c010'><sup>[1010]</sup></a>
Community of wives, at least for the wise, was also probably
among his utopian schemes,<a id='r1011' /><a href='#f1011' class='c010'><sup>[1011]</sup></a> though it is very unlikely that he held
the doctrine in the crass form as reported.<a id='r1012' /><a href='#f1012' class='c010'><sup>[1012]</sup></a> His state is somewhat
suggestive of the Christian ideal, as a unitary whole, a world-cosmos,
united by love.<a id='r1013' /><a href='#f1013' class='c010'><sup>[1013]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>There is a peculiar mixture of individualistic and social conceptions
in the philosophy of the Stoics. In their pictures of an
ideal future world-state, they advanced beyond Plato and other
thinkers, who limited their communities to the small city-state.
In calling their state a “cosmos” also, they gave a positive social
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>content to the narrow individualism of the Cynics.<a id='r1014' /><a href='#f1014' class='c010'><sup>[1014]</sup></a> Moreover, as
seen above, their ideal undoubtedly contained some communistic
elements. However, according to the fundamental tenet of Stoicism,
as expressed by Zeno,<a id='r1015' /><a href='#f1015' class='c010'><sup>[1015]</sup></a> that only the wise can be free and
citizens, we are still faced with the old duality and anti-socialistic
ideal. The Stoics, like the Cynics, were after all essentially individualistic,
and were probably believers in private ownership,
though they dreamed of a future golden age of altruism, when private
property would be no longer necessary.<a id='r1016' /><a href='#f1016' class='c010'><sup>[1016]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Chrysippus, the greatest of the Stoics,<a id='r1017' /><a href='#f1017' class='c010'><sup>[1017]</sup></a> continued and expanded
the principle that virtue is the only absolute good, and that all
other things are indifferents, depending for their worth upon right
use.<a id='r1018' /><a href='#f1018' class='c010'><sup>[1018]</sup></a> But since the wise alone are capable of right use of externals,
they alone are truly wealthy.<a id='r1019' /><a href='#f1019' class='c010'><sup>[1019]</sup></a> They are wealthy, even though beggars,
and noble though slaves.<a id='r1020' /><a href='#f1020' class='c010'><sup>[1020]</sup></a> They are not eager for wealth<a id='r1021' /><a href='#f1021' class='c010'><sup>[1021]</sup></a> yet
they are good economists, since they know the proper source,<a id='r1022' /><a href='#f1022' class='c010'><sup>[1022]</sup></a> time,
method, and extent of money-making. The worthless, on the other
hand, are most needy, even though wealthy.<a id='r1023' /><a href='#f1023' class='c010'><sup>[1023]</sup></a> Chrysippus seems to
have advanced still farther, in teaching the negative doctrine that
wealth is an evil, since it may come from an evil source,[##] an idea suggestive
of the modern theory of “tainted money.” Naturally, he with
the other Stoics, was in sympathy with the Socratics, in objecting
to the use of one’s knowledge for purposes of money-making.<a id='r1024' /><a href='#f1024' class='c010'><sup>[1024]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>The cosmopolitan attitude of the Stoics caused them to be
opposed to the theory of slavery as a natural institution.<a id='r1025' /><a href='#f1025' class='c010'><sup>[1025]</sup></a> They
taught that enforced service is no evidence of slavery,<a id='r1026' /><a href='#f1026' class='c010'><sup>[1026]</sup></a> but that
the real slaves are the ignoble and foolish.<a id='r1027' /><a href='#f1027' class='c010'><sup>[1027]</sup></a> The wise, on the other
hand, alone are free, though they are slaves to countless masters.<a id='r1028' /><a href='#f1028' class='c010'><sup>[1028]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Chrysippus, like Zeno, probably had dreams of a future ideal
state, where the highest eternal law would rule and individual
strivings would be lost in the care for the common weal.<a id='r1029' /><a href='#f1029' class='c010'><sup>[1029]</sup></a> If he
taught family communism, it was doubtless in a Platonic form.<a id='r1030' /><a href='#f1030' class='c010'><sup>[1030]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Utopian social theories after the time of Aristotle were by no
means limited to those of Zeno and Chrysippus. As Souchon has
observed,<a id='r1031' /><a href='#f1031' class='c010'><sup>[1031]</sup></a> the period between the end of the fourth and the beginning
of the second centuries was especially favorable to such speculation.
The skeptical criticism of the Sophists had prepared the
following generations to call in question the most elementary social
principles. Ideal states, such as those of Phaleas and Plato, had
opened the way for future imitations. The conquests of Alexander
had broadened the vision of the Greek, so that he no longer thought
in terms of Plato’s circumscribed city, but rather in terms of a world-state.
Moreover, the utter political confusion and unstable
economic conditions of the time aroused the more serious-minded
to dream of an ideal past or golden age; to idealize the simple,
“natural” life of the so-called “pious” barbarian nomads,<a id='r1032' /><a href='#f1032' class='c010'><sup>[1032]</sup></a> or
even of the animal world, as opposed to the “artificial” conditions
of civilization; and to exaggerate the virtues and communistic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>character of the old Spartan constitution.<a id='r1033' /><a href='#f1033' class='c010'><sup>[1033]</sup></a> The social theories
were largely Stoic in tendency, and thus present a strange combination
of individualistic and communistic ideas.<a id='r1034' /><a href='#f1034' class='c010'><sup>[1034]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Dichaearchus of Messana, a pupil of Aristotle, described an
original paradise, when men lived in accord with nature. In that
golden age, they did not depend upon animals for food, but subsisted
on fruits. Neither did they have any possessions to arouse
hate and strife, until the evil of private property developed, and
caused the degeneration of human society.<a id='r1035' /><a href='#f1035' class='c010'><sup>[1035]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Ephorus,<a id='r1036' /><a href='#f1036' class='c010'><sup>[1036]</sup></a> a disciple of Isocrates, represented the second tendency.
He eulogized the life of the “milk-fed” (γαλακτόφαγοι),
barbarian nomads of the north as true to nature and righteous.<a id='r1037' /><a href='#f1037' class='c010'><sup>[1037]</sup></a>
Their piety and simple life precluded the social ills that arise from
individual ownership,<a id='r1038' /><a href='#f1038' class='c010'><sup>[1038]</sup></a> for their communism even extended to the
family, and all composed one brotherhood.<a id='r1039' /><a href='#f1039' class='c010'><sup>[1039]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The third tendency is evident in the writings of Isocrates,<a id='r1040' /><a href='#f1040' class='c010'><sup>[1040]</sup></a>
Ephorus,<a id='r1041' /><a href='#f1041' class='c010'><sup>[1041]</sup></a> Polybius,<a id='r1042' /><a href='#f1042' class='c010'><sup>[1042]</sup></a> Plutarch,<a id='r1043' /><a href='#f1043' class='c010'><sup>[1043]</sup></a> and was probably common to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>many other thinkers whose works are no longer extant.<a id='r1044' /><a href='#f1044' class='c010'><sup>[1044]</sup></a> They
idealized the ancient Spartan society, as a model of complete communism,
which provided full equality and freedom for the citizens.
It was free from the evils of luxury, excessive wealth, poverty,
civic strife, commerce, and money-greed, a condition where all the
citizens were wise, and where the Stoic ideal of independence
(αὐτάρκεια) was fully realized.<a id='r1045' /><a href='#f1045' class='c010'><sup>[1045]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It was but a step from this to the projection of these bizarre
idealizations of the past and of primitive life into the present and
future. They took the form of ideal utopias such as that of Zeno,<a id='r1046' /><a href='#f1046' class='c010'><sup>[1046]</sup></a>
or of romantic descriptions, purporting to portray ideal conditions
as actually existing, such as found their model in Plato’s <i>Atlantis</i>.<a id='r1047' /><a href='#f1047' class='c010'><sup>[1047]</sup></a>
For a full discussion of this type of literature, the reader may consult
Poehlmann’s work.<a id='r1048' /><a href='#f1048' class='c010'><sup>[1048]</sup></a> We need give it only cursory notice here.</p>

<p class='c002'>Theopompus, a pupil of Socrates, described a “Meropian”
land.<a id='r1049' /><a href='#f1049' class='c010'><sup>[1049]</sup></a> His aim, however, was probably the entertainment of the
reader, rather than social reform, as is evidenced by the fantastic
nature of his stories. They picture not only ideal communistic
conditions, but also a state of the wicked (πονηρόπολις), and
crassly emphasize the alleged free-love of the Etruscans.<a id='r1050' /><a href='#f1050' class='c010'><sup>[1050]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The Cimmerian state of Hecataeus, an idealization of the kingdom
of the Pharaohs, had a more serious social purpose.<a id='r1051' /><a href='#f1051' class='c010'><sup>[1051]</sup></a> It
describes a state in which all conquered lands are equally divided
among the citizens, and where landed property cannot be sold.
The people are free from greed of gain, civic strife, and all the ills
that follow it. The ideal is not the greatest increase of wealth, but
the development of the citizens to the highest social ideal.<a id='r1052' /><a href='#f1052' class='c010'><sup>[1052]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Euhemerus wrote a “Sacred Chronicle” (ἱερὰ ἀναγραφή)<a id='r1053' /><a href='#f1053' class='c010'><sup>[1053]</sup></a> of
an ideal society on an island near India, ruled by a priestly aristocracy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Here, labor was held in high regard. The artisans were
in the priestly class, the farmers were second, and the herdsmen
were on an equality with the soldiers.<a id='r1054' /><a href='#f1054' class='c010'><sup>[1054]</sup></a> All land and other means
of production were common, except the house and garden (κήπου).<a id='r1055' /><a href='#f1055' class='c010'><sup>[1055]</sup></a>
The land was not worked collectively, but farmers and herdsmen
alike brought their products to a common storehouse for common
consumption.<a id='r1056' /><a href='#f1056' class='c010'><sup>[1056]</sup></a> Thus neither money nor commercial class was
necessary.</p>

<p class='c002'>Jambulus, in his “Sun State,”<a id='r1057' /><a href='#f1057' class='c010'><sup>[1057]</sup></a> outdoes even Euhemerus in
his communistic ideas. He describes a sort of paradise of sun-worshipers
at the equator. Here the trees never fail of ripe fruit,
and the citizens never lose their strength and beauty. The whole
social and economic life is under communistic régime. There is
collective ownership of all the means of production, and each must
take his turn at each kind of work.<a id='r1058' /><a href='#f1058' class='c010'><sup>[1058]</sup></a> The communism extends
also to the family.<a id='r1059' /><a href='#f1059' class='c010'><sup>[1059]</sup></a> Thus Greek economic and social speculation,
which always contained socialistic elements, ends in a communism
for the whole citizenship, so thorough as to include both products
and means of production, and to demand a leveling even of the
natural inequalities that result from the different kinds of work.</p>

  <h2 id='chap8' class='c005' title='VIII. General Conclusions'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> GENERAL CONCLUSIONS ON THE IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF GREEK ECONOMICS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Our conclusions as to the importance and influence of Greek
economic thought have been fully presented in the previous discussion.
A brief summary of the results, however, may be of
advantage now, at the close of our survey. As seen above, despite
the fact that Greek thought in this field was incidental to moral
and political speculation, and despite a certain philosophic prejudice
and limited economic vision, the contribution is by no means merely
negative. We have seen that it included a recognition by one or
more Greek thinkers of such important principles as the following:
that society finds its origin in mutual need, and in the natural
development of clan and family, not in the artificial social contract;
that the state is a great business association, in which about the
same economic laws apply as in private economy; that the final
goal of economics is not property but human welfare; that the
criteria of economic value are intrinsic utility, economic demand,
and cost of production; that wealth must possess the quality of
storableness; that true wealth consists only of commodities that
minister to human welfare; that the three factors in production
are land, labor and capital; that money originated in necessary
exchange; that it serves as a medium of exchange, a standard of
value, and a ticket of deferred payments; that it should possess
intrinsic value, which is more stable than that of other commodities;
that it should not be confused with wealth, but should be
understood in its true function as representative wealth; that
credit must play an exceedingly important part in business operations
as representative capital; that agriculture is the basal industry,
on which all others must depend; that the division of labor is
the fundamental principle at the foundation of all exchange; that
it results in certain important economic advantages, and that its
extensive application depends upon large commercial development;
that reciprocity is the fundamental principle in exchange,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>as also in the social structure; that exchange performs a legitimate
social function in creating time and place values; that industrial
expansion is limited by a law of diminishing returns; that the primary
purpose of exchange should not be profit, but satisfaction
of economic need; that commerce merely for its own sake does not
necessarily increase the national store, but may produce only
economic inequalities; that extremes of wealth and poverty cause
industrial inefficiency, social strife, and crime; that excessive
individual wealth is not usually compatible with just acquisition
or just expenditure; that it also necessarily implies corresponding
extremes of poverty; that the commercial spirit in nations is the
chief cause of international differences; that the goal of economics
is consumption rather than production, and that foolish consumption
results in great economic waste; that all economic problems
are moral problems; that private property is not a natural right,
but a gift of society, and therefore that society may properly control
its activities; that there is a certain unity in human nature,
which is opposed to the doctrine of natural slavery; that the
individual should have opportunity for personal development in
accord with his capacities, aside from the mere struggle for physical
existence; that true economic equality does not demand equal
shares for all, but shares proportioned to capacities and services;
and that gifts of charity merely for consumption are fruitful causes
of poverty and indolence.</p>

<p class='c002'>Besides the recognition of such principles, we have seen that
many practical suggestions for the amelioration of economic and
social conditions, which are being seriously presented today, were
first proposed by Greek thinkers. Measures for the divorce of
government from big business, state control of natural monopolies,
conservation of natural resources, state supervision of trade and
commerce, including regulation of prices and rates, publicity in
business, pure food laws, and the socialization of industry and its
products were all first proposed by Greeks. On the other hand,
we have seen that practically all the modern stock arguments
against socialism were long ago presented by Aristotle, and that
the ideal of the Greek socialist was not primarily materialistic and
selfish, as the modern, but moral and social.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Such a list of positive economic principles and practical suggestions
should surely give the Greeks some claim to recognition
in the field of economic thought. But they should be judged
primarily, not by their positive contribution to economic theory
or by the practical nature of their suggestions for legislation, but
rather by the extent to which they realized the existence of the
great economic and social problems, which are still crying for a
solution. From this standpoint, we have seen that Plato and
Aristotle especially reveal remarkable economic insight. Moreover,
there still remains the outstanding fact that the Greeks were
the forerunners of the moral, humanitarian, and social emphasis
in present-day economy. This alone should give to them a distinct
place in the evolution of economic thought, and should make it
impossible for Souchon to conclude: “Ces mépris [of G. B. Say]
sont pour nous apparaître plus justifiés que les admirations de
Roscher.”<a id='r1060' /><a href='#f1060' class='c010'><sup>[1060]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The influence of Greek thought upon later economic theory,
however, seems not to have been very direct or extensive, probably
owing to the incidental nature of their speculation. To be sure,
mediaeval economic thought presents, in many respects, an
unbroken continuity with the Greek. In their emphasis on the
moral, in their doctrines on usury, just price, importance of agriculture,
exchange for profit, and in their general conservative attitude
toward money and commercial development, mediaeval
thinkers are very similar to the Socratics.<a id='r1061' /><a href='#f1061' class='c010'><sup>[1061]</sup></a> Doubtless much of
this similarity may be traced to the direct influence of Aristotle, as
is especially evident in the work of Thomas Aquinas and Nicholas
Oresme.<a id='r1062' /><a href='#f1062' class='c010'><sup>[1062]</sup></a> To a considerable extent, however, the economic ideas
of the Middle Ages were a direct outgrowth of the economic and
religious conditions under which the writers lived.<a id='r1063' /><a href='#f1063' class='c010'><sup>[1063]</sup></a> In the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>centuries, some Greek influence may be traced in Adam Smith, in
the physiocrats,<a id='r1064' /><a href='#f1064' class='c010'><sup>[1064]</sup></a> in utopian writers such as More, and in eighteenth-century
thinkers like Rousseau.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is usually asserted that the economic thought of the past
century has been practically unaffected by Greek ideas. But our
previous discussion has clearly shown that Plato and Xenophon,
at least, dominated the economic thinking of Ruskin. If further
evidence is needed, it is necessary only to turn to the names of
Greek thinkers in the index to the monumental new edition of his
works, which we have frequently cited above. He frankly and
enthusiastically presents himself as an apostle of a “Greek theory
of economics.”<a id='r1065' /><a href='#f1065' class='c010'><sup>[1065]</sup></a> But despite some of his utopian and extravagant
ideas, he is being ever more recognized by authorities in economics
as having been one of the chief factors in the development of
political economy to its present moral and humanitarian emphasis.<a id='r1066' /><a href='#f1066' class='c010'><sup>[1066]</sup></a>
His repudiation of the abstract “economic man,” his insistence
upon human, moral, and social ideals in economics, his attempt to
broaden the definition of economic value and wealth by emphasizing
true utility, his constant stress upon proper consumption rather
than upon production, his demand that all have opportunity up to
their capacity, his opposition to the <i>laissez-faire</i> policy in economics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>and politics, his emphasis upon right education, all have borne
rich and abiding fruit in the last few decades, and these are all distinctively
Greek ideas, as we have seen above. Thus indirectly,
through Ruskin, Greek economic thought has exerted a potent
influence upon the evolution of nineteenth-century economics, and
thus there is much truth in the words of Wagner, as quoted by
Oncken,<a id='r1067' /><a href='#f1067' class='c010'><sup>[1067]</sup></a> not merely for German, but for all modern economy:
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Es ist im Grunde uralter wahrhaft classischer Boden, auf den
jetzt die deutsche ökonomische und soziale Theorie und Praxis sich
bewusst wieder stellen.”</span> Souchon’s characterization of Greek
economy as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“morale étatisme”</span><a id='r1068' /><a href='#f1068' class='c010'><sup>[1068]</sup></a> could well be applied to much in
the economic thought of today.</p>

<p class='c002'>As stated, a large number of the foregoing list deal chiefly with actual
conditions, rather than with theory. Besides these, many other works on
phases of Greek economic history are cited in the course of our discussion,
the names of which, with page-references, may be found in the index. All other
works that are incidentally cited are also listed there. For an excellent presentation
of the political economy of John Ruskin, and a selected bibliography
on his work as a social and economic reformer, cf. the Library Edition of his
works, from which we have often cited (George Allen, London, Introduction
to Vol. XVII, 1905; bibliography, p. cxii).</p>

idea that all should do some head and some hand work. Poehlmann (II, 391, n. 2)
compares it to the socialism of Bebel. The implication that Plato’s state is distinguished
from this, as a society of citizens who do not work (402 f.), is hardly fair.
The proper distinction is rather that Plato insists that each citizen do the particular
kind of work for which he is best fitted. It is needless to ask which had the saner
view, from the economic or any other standpoint. Jambulus’ repudiation of the
division of labor in the interest of equality is certainly one of the most radical measures
ever suggested in the history of communism.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
